Liu Qing is also known as Jean Liu in English."
"Sanjay Shah, who was arrested in June 2022 in Dubai where he was living, is accused of running a nine-billion-kroner ($1.32-billion) scam that enabled companies he controlled to fraudulently claim Danish tax refunds between 2012 and 2015.

Seagate (STX) sold the drives to Huawei between August 2020 and September 2021 despite an August 2020 rule that restricted sales of certain foreign items made with US technology to the company. Huawei was placed on the Entity List, a US trade blacklist, in 2019 to reduce the sale of US goods to the company amid national security and foreign policy concerns.  The penalty represents the latest in a string of actions by Washington to keep sophisticated technology from China that may support its military, enable human rights abuses or otherwise threaten US security."
"A Malaysian woman pleaded guilty on Sunday (May 21) to negligence while caring for two babies at a childcare centre in Skudai, Johor.   Nurul Shahira A'shiqin Sulaiman pleaded guilty at the Johor Bahru Sessions Court to two charges of negligence that may have led to physical injury to an 11-month girl and a nine-month boy.

"Two 10-year-old children were found working at a Louisville McDonald’s restaurant — sometimes until 2 a.m. — the US Department of Labor said Tuesday.  The revelation was part of an investigation into the child labor law violations in the Southeast. The agency also found three franchisees that own more than 60 McDonald’s locations in Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland and Ohio, “employed 305 children to work more than the legally permitted hours and perform tasks prohibited by law for young workers,” the Labor Department said in a statement.  “Investigators from the department’s Wage and Hour Division found two 10-year-old workers at a Louisville McDonald’s restaurant among many violations of federal labor laws committed by three Kentucky McDonald’s franchise operators,” the release said. “Investigators also determined two 10-year-old children were employed – but not paid – and sometimes worked as late as 2 a.m.”"
"The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group says he received up to HK$3,000 from security officers per meeting to become an informant when he was released from jail in June before he fled to Britain and sought political asylum.  In November 2021, Tony Chung, who was then 20, was sentenced to 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering. Chung was charged with secession under a sweeping national security law imposed by China in 2020 and denied bail. He pleaded guilty.  He said on Thursday (Dec 28) he fled to Britain after he was freed and had formally applied for political asylum."
"In 2018 at the Irish High Court, a judgment was delivered against the Byrne Organized Crime Group, which it said is part of a wider international Kinahan Organized Crime Group.  The court heard that the Kinahan Organized Crime Group was involved in the “importation and distribution of controlled drugs and firearms into Ireland, the UK and mainland Europe” and that operations of “drug trafficking are managed and controlled” by Daniel Kinahan.  The law firm representing Kinahan did not respond to CNN’s question as to where the Irishman was currently based, though it’s been widely reportedly he’s living in the United Arab Emirates."

Thunberg, 20, was fined 1,500 Swedish crowns (US$134) by a Swedish court on Jul 24 for failing to leave a protest when ordered by police.  Straight after the verdict, Thunberg and other activists from the environmental group Reclaim the Future blocked the road for oil trucks in Malmo harbour and were again forcibly removed by police.

"A Hong Kong court on Thursday found four people guilty of rioting after the legislature of the financial centre was stormed during pro-democracy protests in 2019.  The verdict comes after eight others had already plead guilty to charges over the incident when hundreds of protesters besieged Hong Kong's Legislative Council building on July 1, 2019.  The incursion into the seat of government for the Chinese Special Administrative Region followed a protest march against a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed authorities to send individuals to mainland China for trial.

Ho, who suffers from mild intellectual disability, cried inside the courtroom after the verdict was read."
"HO CHI MINH CITY: Vietnam's top soft drinks tycoon was jailed for eight years on Thursday (Apr 25) in a US$40 million fraud case – the latest high-profile business figure snared in the country's sweeping crackdown on corruption.  The communist nation's wide-ranging campaign to wipe out endemic graft has seen more than 4,400 people charged with criminal offences, including officials and senior business figures.  A court in Ho Chi Minh City found Tran Qui Thanh and his two daughters guilty of scamming investors over loans issued in 2019 and 2020.

"A director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Gilbert Oh Hin Kwan, was on Nov 23 charged with deceiving MFA, abetting the cheating of the ministry and giving false information to a public servant.  Oh, a 44-year-old Singaporean, faces three charges. His name is not found on MFA’s website.  Oh allegedly dishonestly concealed from MFA the fact that a package containing boxes of Panadol sent from Singapore to Beijing via the diplomatic bag service was for a personal acquaintance rather than for his colleague, Mr Dion Loke Cheng Wang.  His charge stated that MFA accepted the package for dispatch in December 2022 on the basis that it was for Mr Loke. It would not have done so had it known the truth.  Mr Loke is listed as a first secretary (political) of MFA’s Beijing embassy."

"India's air safety watchdog fined Tata Group-owned Air India 8 million rupees ($95,658) for violating flight duty time limitations and fatigue management systems of its flight crew.  In January, the aviation regulator increased the mandatory weekly rest period for flight crew to 48 hours from 36 hours, a decision that followed a review of pilot fatigue data after an IndiGo (INGL.NS), opens new tab pilot collapsed and died in August last year before his flight.

The Cyberspace Administration of China said it fined Didi 8.026 billion yuan ($1.19 billion) after deciding the company violated China’s network security law, data security law and personal information protection law.  The administration also fined two Didi executives 1 million yuan each.  Didi said in an online statement it accepted the cybersecurity regulators decision.

"Indonesia's anti-monopoly agency (KPPU) ordered seven cooking oil companies on Friday to pay fines of up to $2.8 million for restricting sales amid scarce supplies last year.  KPPU launched an investigation into the conduct of cooking oil companies last year after the Indonesian government placed a temporary cap on surging retail prices of the essential product and later a three-week export ban on palm oil.  Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of palm oil, commonly used as cooking oil.  Seven out of 27 companies investigated were found guilty of limiting distribution of their branded cooking oils while the retail price cap was in place in early 2022, said Dinni Melanie, who chaired the KPPU panel.  The seven companies include Salim Ivomas Pratama (SIMP.JK), a unit of Indonesia's largest food company Indofood Group, as well as two units of Wilmar Group."
"Italy’s competition authority has fined TikTok €10 million ($11 million) for failing to control the spread of content that it said threatened the safety of minors and other vulnerable people.  The antitrust agency, AGCM, said Thursday that TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, had failed to take into account the specific vulnerabilities of adolescents using its platform, such as a tendency toward copying group behaviors.  The watchdog announced an investigation into TikTok’s content moderation practices last March.  In a statement Thursday, it said the video-sharing platform “has not taken adequate measures to avoid the spread of (harmful) content,” adding that its algorithms meant such content could be “systematically re-proposed to users.”"
"An Iranian court has sentenced prominent film-maker Mohammad Rasoulof to jail time for “collusion against national security”, his lawyer Babak Paknia said on May 8.  Rasoulof’s new drama The Seed Of The Sacred Fig is due to premiere at the main competition at Cannes Film Festival on May 24.  The director, 52, has been sentenced to eight years in prison but will only serve five, Mr Paknia said in a post on social media platform X.  Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently.  According to the lawyer, the verdict had been confirmed by the appeals court and also included “flogging, a fine, and confiscation of property”.  He said that the court had found Rasoulof guilty of “collusion against national security”.  Official media in Iran have yet to publish the verdict."
"The European Union on Tuesday (Nov 8) imposed sanctions on several senior officials and armed forces officers in Myanmar, where a military takeover last year set off violence that threatens to destabilise other parts of Southeast Asia.  The EU froze the assets of 19 people – including Investment and Foreign Economic Relations Minister Kan Zaw and the chief justice at Myanmar’s supreme court, top military brass and businesspeople linked to the armed forces – and banned them from traveling in Europe.  The 27-nation bloc also froze the assets in Europe of Myanmar’s State Administration Council. EU headquarters said in a statement that the SAC, set up in February 2021 following a military coup, “is responsible for policies and activities that undermine democracy and the rule of law”."
"The European Union said on Thursday (Jul 20) it was imposing restrictive measures against 18 individuals and 5 entities for human rights violations in Afghanistan, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Ukraine and Russia.  The Taliban ministers of Education and Justice as well as the acting Taliban Chief Justice of the Afghanistan Supreme Court are among the six individuals sanctioned because of their sexual and gender-based violence, the EU said in a statement.  It also imposed restrictive measures against twelve other individuals and five entities responsible for serious human rights violations in Russia, referring to people who have misused facial recognition technology for ""arbitrary arrests"" and the politically motivated rulings against outspoken Kremlin critics like Alexei Navalny and Vladimir Kara-Murza."
"European Union foreign ministers imposed new sanctions on Monday (Nov 12) on Iranian clerics, senior officials and top state media employees over the brutal crackdown on protesters, and also on experts they believe are linked to supplying Russia with explosive drones to use in its war against Ukraine.  The ministers imposed bans on travelling to Europe and froze the assets of 20 individuals. They also froze the assets of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, saying the media outlet was a “mouthpiece” for “the violent response to the recent demonstrations in Iran"".  Iranian women - and some men - have protested the government’s severe restrictions on their daily life since late September after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code."
"The Indian government announced a ban on 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok, which is operated by Chinese internet firm Bytedance, in June as its relations with China deteriorated. It said the apps were prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India.  China says New Delhi has been using national security as an excuse to prohibit Chinese mobile apps.  China’s government on Thursday criticized Indian moves to ban Baidu, TikTok and other popular Chinese apps and appealed to New Delhi to get economic ties “back on track.”  “China opposes any discriminatory restrictive measures against Chinese companies,” said a Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng."
"China's foreign ministry said on Friday (Aug 12) it had imposed sanctions on Lithuanian Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Agne Vaiciukeviciute for visiting Taiwan, the latest development in Beijing's diplomatic row with the European Union country.  The foreign ministry said China would also suspend engagement with Vaiciukeviciute's ministry and cooperation on transportation with Lithuania, a small Baltic republic.  Lithuania's Ministry of Transport and Communications said it regretted China's announcement.  ""Beijing is choosing to continue and intensify the course of illegal actions against (an) EU member state,"" the Lithuanian ministry said in a statement to Reuters.  ""This is not only not conducive to the development of China's relations with the democratic world, but also reverses Beijing's own declared policy so far of not hindering the development of a mutually beneficial relationship with Taiwan, one of the world's most progressive economies."""
"The US on Thursday (Dec 28) imposed sanctions on a group of money exchange services from Yemen and Türkiye alleged to help provide funding to Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who have been launching attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the southern Red Sea.  Included in the sanctions are the head of a financial intermediary in Sana’a, Yemen, along with three exchange houses in Yemen and Türkiye. US Treasury alleges that the people and firms helped transfer millions of dollars to the Houthis at the direction of sanctioned Iranian financial facilitator Sa’id al-Jamal.  The sanctions block access to US property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans."
"Singapore has joined over 30 other countries in issuing sanctions against Russia in protest of its invasion of Ukraine. They prohibit certain financial and business transactions with the Russian government and with certain Russian entities and individuals.   While the point of sanctions is to put pressure on Russia to stop the war, will they have the desired effect?    About a month after sanctions were first implemented, amidst a striking breakdown of diplomatic relations, Russia made the veiled statement – which only served to escalate tensions – that it would only use nuclear weapons if its existence is threatened.    It’s not clear whether the sanctions can motivate Russia to come to an amicable resolution of the conflict. What is clear, however, is that sanctions often come at an economic cost to the countries imposing them. "
"Myanmar's military regime is now facing a harder time in getting access to funding globally.  Singapore's United Overseas Bank (UOB) is cutting off ties with banks in Myanmar from Friday (Sep 1), a move that is in step with international sanctions targeting Myanmar's banking industry.  The bank will restrict all incoming and outgoing payments to and from Myanmar accounts. It will also put curbs on Visa and Mastercard transactions from Myanmar.  With this latest move, the Singapore lender is effectively severing ties with its Myanmar counterparts.   CNA has reached out to the bank but UOB said it cannot comment on client relationships."
"The United States on Wednesday (Aug 23) expanded its sanctions against Myanmar to include foreign companies or individuals helping the country’s military junta to procure jet fuel that it uses to launch airstrikes on its own people, the US Treasury Department said in a statement.  The Treasury was also adding to its sanctions list two individuals, Khin Phyu Win and Zaw Min Tun, as well as three companies linked to them, who are involved in procurement and distribution of jet fuel for the military, which seized power in a February 2021 coup, it said.  The Treasury said it was issuing a determination that identifies the jet fuel sector in Myanmar as covered by an executive order signed by President Joe Biden blocking companies outside of Myanmar from dealing with the country’s defence sector."
"North Korea's economy shrank for a third consecutive year in 2022, as COVID-19 restrictions and U.N. sanctions continued to weigh on economic activity in the isolated authoritarian state, according to estimates by the South's central bank.  Foreign trade posted a record rebound, however, after drying up during the pandemic and indicating a loosening of border controls. China is by far the country's main trading partner.  Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 0.2 per cent in real terms in 2022, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said on Friday, after a 0.1 per cent fall in 2021 and the prior year's 4.5 per cent plunge - the worst since 1997."
"At the same time, he has pursued policies that aim to centralise and consolidate political control over market participants and enterprises, as well as extract more income from these enterprises.  Even during the pandemic, the regime has attempted to maintain income for the state and supplies for state-controlled traders. Throughout the pandemic, North Korean and third-country flagged ships have continued ship-to-ship transfers of oil in international waters in violation of UN sanctions.  Presumably, North Korea has enough foreign currency, or at least the equivalent in barter goods, to pay for the oil. North Korea also continued exporting millions of tons of coal, largely to China via illicit ship transfers and port visits, to bring in hard currency."
"Turkey's fiery prime minister ratcheted up rapidly-escalating tensions with Israel on Tuesday, comparing Ankara's once-close middle eastern ally to a ""spoiled boy"" and announcing additional sanctions would soon be imposed.  ""We are completely suspending all of these, trade relations, military relations, related with the defense industry,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency. ""All of these are completely suspended and other measures will follow this process.""  Asked to clarify whether this meant Turkey will halt more than $3 billion in bilateral trade, an official in the Turkish prime ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol, insisted Erdogan was not referring to trade relations."
"The Chinese government on Wednesday (Dec 27) threatened to place further trade sanctions on Taiwan if the ruling party ""stubbornly"" adheres to supporting independence, in a further escalation of the war of words as Taiwanese elections approach next month.  Taiwan's Jan 13 presidential and parliamentary elections are taking place as China, which views the island as its own territory, has sought to force Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty claims.  Taiwan this month accused China of economic coercion and election interference after Beijing announced the end of tariff cuts on some chemical imports from the island, saying Taipei violated a trade agreement between the two sides signed in 2010."
"Taiwan will take part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco this week (Nov 13 -17), a rare opportunity for the self-governing island democracy of 23 million people and its high-tech economy to break the diplomatic embargo on it imposed by authoritarian China.  Taiwan's chief delegate will be a civilian rather than a government figure or head of state, under an unwritten rule that satisfies China’s contention that members of the organization participate as economic entities rather than state players.  For the seventh time, Taiwan will be represented by Morris Chang, the 92-year-old founder of the world-leading Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Chang is known as the godfather of the industry that has put Taiwan in the top ranks of high-tech manufacturing and personal electronic devices."
"Cheung said later he could not comment on individual cases, including that of Lai.  United States officials have also called for Lai's release, while a bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced a bill in November to sanction Hong Kong judges and officials involved with national security prosecutions.  The Lai case is seen by some foreign envoys, scholars and local lawyers as a key test for the city's judicial independence and freedoms under the sweeping national security law imposed by China in 2020.  Chinese and Hong Kong officials say the new law was vital to restore stability after months of pro-democracy protests rocked city in 2019."
"The United States Treasury Department on Wednesday (Feb 1) blacklisted a Singapore trading company and its 65-year-old Singaporean director over their involvement in a Russian sanctions evasion network.  ""Full blocking sanctions"" were imposed against Ms Serena Ng Bee Lin and Asia Trading & Construction, which the US Treasury identified as a shell company that ""sold helicopters to a Latin American government on behalf of"" a Russian state-owned defence conglomerate.  They were among 22 individuals and entities across multiple countries who were identified as part of a network led by Russia- and Cyprus-based arms dealer Igor Vladimirovich Zimenkov.  The Zimenkov network has ""engaged in projects connected to Russian defence capabilities, including supplying a Russian company with high-technology devices"" after Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb 24 last year, said the US Treasury in a press release."
"Wine exports to China hit a record A$1.30 billion (S$1.34 billion) in 2019, according to Australian government data, making it the biggest market by value for the product.  Late last year, Australia also called for the WTO to investigate Chinese tariffs on barley imports, following a series of economic sanctions or disruptions to Australian products to China's vast market.  Diplomatic relations between the two countries have reached their lowest since the deadly 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.  Many see the sanctions as retribution for Australia blocking Chinese investment in sensitive areas and publicly calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus."
"The United States on Wednesday (Jun 21) imposed sanctions on Myanmar's defense ministry and two banks used by the ruling military junta to buy arms and other goods from foreign sources.  The US Treasury Department said in a statement the military has relied on foreign sources, including Russian entities under sanctions, to purchase and import arms, equipment and raw materials to manufacture weapons to support its ""brutal repression"".  Washington accused the defense ministry of importing goods and materiel worth at least US$1 billion since the 2021 coup in which the military leaders seized power.  State-owned Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), were also hit with sanctions. The Treasury said they allowed revenue-generating state-owned enterprises, including Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), access to international markets."
"A key player has re-entered the world’s energy market, as the United States seeks other sources of fuel amid a global energy crunch.  Venezuela used to produce more than 3 million barrels of oil daily two decades ago, before corruption and a drop in oil prices destroyed the sector and the country’s economy.  Former US president Donald Trump had imposed sanctions against Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in 2019, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has since shifted political priorities.  The US has been pushed to reconsider its ties with oil producers like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, to mitigate dependence on Russian energy."
"Grossi was met with angry protests by civic groups as he arrived in South Korea on Friday from Japan and drew street rallies on Saturday criticising the plan.  South Korea's government said on Friday it respected the IAEA's report and that its own analysis had found the release will not have ""any meaningful impact"" on its waters.  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Wednesday criticised the move towards discharging the water and threatened action if the plan should move ahead.  North Korea also criticised IAEA's backing of Japan's plan, calling it ""unjust"" and a demonstration of double standards, citing the UN nuclear watchdog's work to curb Pyongyang's nuclear programme.  North Korea has faced UN Security Council sanctions for its six underground nuclear tests. "
"Russia considers South Korea's decision to impose sanctions against Russian individuals and entities as an ""unfriendly"" move and will respond in due course, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday (Apr 3).  South Korea has imposed sanctions against two Russian vessels which it says were carrying military cargo to North Korea. Seoul said on Tuesday it had also sanctioned two Russian organisations and two Russian citizens linked to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes.  ""This is an unfriendly move by Seoul and is deeply regrettable. The imposition of - I emphasise - illegitimate sanctions will have a negative impact on relations with Russia,"" Zakharova told reporters at her weekly briefing."
"China has for years been guiding money into its innovative companies, but investors sensed an urgency for technology independence this week after the United States threatened to sanction chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies (CXMT), and Japan published rules to restrict semiconductor exports to China.  ""We must choose to stand with our country ... and make long-term asset allocation in line with the country's needs,"" Liu Tuoqi, head of investment at Shanghai Zhangying Investment Management Co, told investors in a roadshow, describing the Sino-U.S. conflict as ""irreconcilable"".  But there's a silver lining in the tech spat, he added. ""It forces us to make chips ourselves ... the higher the wind and waves, the pricier the fish."""
"China will sanction five US military manufacturers in response to the latest round of US arms sales to Taiwan, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Sunday (Jan 7).  US arms sales to Taiwan are a frequent source of tension between Washington and Beijing. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, a claim Taiwan's government rejects.  The sanctions come ahead of Taiwan's Jan 13 presidential and parliamentary elections, which China has cast as a choice between war and peace.  The US State Department last month approved US$300 million sale of equipment to help maintain Taiwan's tactical information systems.  The spokesperson said in a statement the recent arms sales ""seriously undermine China's sovereignty and security interests, seriously jeopardise peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait""."
"The Iranians were not totally unscathed, however. Washington has announced sanctions against senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, as well as criminal charges against several people who had a direct role in funding Hamas and Hezbollah. The effects of these actions are negligible, however. Iran has long been under wide-ranging strictures, and the latest moves are unlikely to make things much worse for it.  What remains to be seen is whether both sides will decide that enough is enough, after all is said and done.  Iran will have to tread even more carefully now after the latest round of strikes. It must know that despite the latest US action, pressure is mounting on Mr Biden to do more."
"Britain and the United States on Thursday (Jan 25) said they had imposed coordinated sanctions on four key Houthi figures for their roles in supporting or directing attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.  Attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis have disrupted global shipping and stoked fears of global inflation. They have also deepened concern that fallout from the Israel-Hamas war could destabilize the Middle East.  Those sanctioned were Houthi Defence Minister Mohamed Nasser al-Atifi, Commander of Houthi Naval Forces Muhammad Fadl Abd Al-Nabi, coastal defence forces chief Muhammad Ali al-Qadiri and Muhammed Ahmad al-Talibi, who the two governments described as the Houthi forces' director of procurement."
"The Biden administration is turning up the heat on China's top sanctioned chipmaker by cutting off its most advanced factory from more American imports after it produced a sophisticated chip for Huawei's Mate 60 Pro phone, three people familiar with the matter said.  Late last year, the Commerce Department sent dozens of letters to U.S. suppliers to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), suspending permission to sell to its most advanced plant, said two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.  While many companies had already stopped selling to SMIC South, as the unit is known, the letters halted millions of dollars worth of shipments of chipmaking materials and parts from at least one supplier, Entegris, one of the people said."
"Taiwan's government has opened an investigation into four companies named in a media report as conducting business with firms linked to United States-sanctioned Huawei in China, and is considering tighter rules on key technologies.  Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said the ministry would be looking into whether the firms' activities in China ""matched up"" with their initial investment approval from the island's government.  ""If not, then the highest permitted fine is up to NT$25 million (US$775,300),"" she said.  Wang did not give details on what rules the companies might have broken. She said earlier this week they had been engaged in low-end work like handling wastewater."
"Canada announced targeted sanctions Thursday (Nov 29) against 17 Saudi nationals it said were linked to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul last month.  The sanctions, which freezes their assets and bars their travel to Canada, ""target individuals who are, in the opinion of the government of Canada, responsible for or complicit in the extrajudicial killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct 2, 2018,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.  At the same time, Ottawa continued to call for ""a transparent and rigorous accounting of the circumstances"" surrounding Khashoggi's murder, saying that ""the explanations offered to date by Saudi Arabia lack consistency and credibility""."
"China imposed sanctions on nearly 30 former Trump administration officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, moments after they left office on Thursday (Jan 21).  In a statement released just minutes after President Joe Biden was inaugurated, Beijing slapped travel bans and business restrictions on Pompeo, national security adviser Robert O’Brien and UN ambassador Kelly Craft.  Others covered by the sanctions include Trump’s economic adviser Peter Navarro; his top diplomat for Asia, David Stilwell; health and human services secretary, Alex Azar; along with former national security adviser John Bolton and strategist Stephen Bannon.   The sanctions are largely symbolic but underscore Beijing’s antipathy toward a US administration it regarded as hostile."
"In 2019, Japan’s government tightened export controls on three materials to South Korea — fluorinated polyimide, hydrogen fluoride and resists — key materials used in the production of semiconductors. The two countries are also discussing restoring each other’s trade status.  The South Korean trade ministry also said it plans to revise government export regulations to restore Japan’s status as a favored trade destination for the export of “strategic” materials that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.  The South Korean ministry said it will continue to engage in broader talks with its Japanese counterparts to discuss both countries restoring their “white lists” of nations enjoying minimum trade restrictions, after Tokyo and Seoul downgraded each other’s trade status during the 2019 dispute."
"In the 2010 sanctions, South Korea effectively shut down all cross-border economic cooperation except for a jointly run factory park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and banned North Korea from using shipping lanes in South Korean territory. The Kaesong factory park was shuttered in 2016 in response to a North Korean nuclear test and long-range rocket launch.  During Moon’s visit to North Korea last month, he and Kim agreed to normalize operations at the Kaesong factory park and resume joint tours to North Korea when possible, voicing optimism that international sanctions could end and allow such projects."
"The man who India claims planned the Kashmir bomb attack that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war has been designated a terrorist by the United Nations Security Council after China dropped its objections.  India welcomed Wednesday’s move against Masood Azhar, head of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). The Indian government holds the group responsible for the February suicide bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitary soldiers.  The addition of Azhar to the sanctions list came after China dropped its long-held objections to the move. Beijing put a “technical” hold on a UN resolution in March – the fourth time it had scuttled India’s attempt to sanction the man it holds responsible for multiple terror attacks in India"
"The United States and the United Kingdom announced widespread sanctions against Iran's military drone program on Thursday (Apr 18) in response to its weekend attack against Israel.  Washington is targeting ""16 individuals and two entities enabling Iran's UAV production, including engine types that power Iran's Shahed variant UAVs, which were used in the Apr 13 attack,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement, referring to Iran's unmanned aerial vehicle program.  Tehran launched its first-ever direct military attack on Israel late on Saturday in retaliation for an Apr 1 air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus - widely blamed on Israel - that killed seven members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including two generals."
"The Canadian government is imposing new sanctions on two Iranians it accuses of participating in the violent repression of women and girls in Iran.  Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly is making the announcement on International Women's Day.  Joly says Iranian women and girls face an increasingly repressive environment where they risk injury or death for expressing themselves or demanding basic rights.  Canada has now laid sanctions against 155 individuals and 87 entities since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in 2022.  Amini died in police custody after being arrested, purportedly for wearing her hijab incorrectly.  The chief executive of the capital city's transit system and a senior parliamentarian are both being added to the list for carrying out ""increasingly repressive measures."""
"The US Treasury in October imposed sanctions on 10 key Hamas group members, operatives, and financial facilitators in Gaza and elsewhere, including Sudan, Türkiye, Algeria and Qatar.  Mr Reimer said: “The US sanctions against financial facilitators in (multiple) countries have pointed out how vast and highly sophisticated this network is.”  However, with the scale of Israel’s campaign aimed at destroying the militant group, Hamas’ control of the Gaza Strip – its main source of financing – is likely to be greatly diminished in the conflict, he said.  “If Hamas is no longer the de facto authority, that will reduce Hamas’ ability to generate revenue … which could force it to become more of a guerrilla-type organisation,” said Mr Reimer."
"Australia was among a host of countries that imposed fresh sanctions on Myanmar on February 1, the third anniversary of the military coup. The government added five businesses to its list of 16 individuals sanctioned since 2021.  Australia has targeted two banks that help fund Myanmar’s junta and its arms purchases, the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank and Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank. The sanctions also target three other entities, Asia Sun Group, Asia Sun Trading Co Ltd, and Cargo Link Petroleum Logistics Co Ltd, for their role in supplying jet fuel to the security forces: the same fuel that the military has used to carry out unlawfully indiscriminate airstrikes against civilians."
"The two Chinese nationals sanctioned by the UK are Zhao Guangzong and Ni Gaobin and the company is Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology Company Ltd, said by the British government to work for the China state-affiliated cyber espionage group Advanced Persistent Threat Group 31 (APT31).  The UK sanctions will freeze assets, barring UK citizens and businesses from handling their funds or resources. A travel ban will also prevent them from entering or remaining in the UK.  ""The UK will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,"" Mr Dowden said. ""It is an absolute priority for the UK government to protect our democratic system and values."""
"The UK has imposed sanctions against four ""extremist"" Israeli settlers it has accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.  The Foreign Office announced financial and travel restrictions against the four who it says have committed human rights abuses against Palestinians.  Lord Cameron also called on Israel to take action to end the violence.  West Bank violence has surged since the start of the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October.  At least 384 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - have been killed in conflict-related incidents in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, or in Israel, according to the UN."
"Since 2014, the US has imposed travel bans, asset freezes and economic restrictions on hundreds of Russian individuals and companies, part of a multinational effort to punish President Vladimir Putin’s government for alleged troublemaking beyond its borders and online. With Russia again massing troops and military equipment near the border with Ukraine, the US and its allies are weighing further sanctions in case the conflict escalates.    WHAT US SANCTIONS ARE IN PLACE AGAINST RUSSIA?  More people and companies in Russia have been hit by US sanctions in the last decade than any country other than Iran. Some, including business magnates and close political allies of Putin, are banned from doing business with US companies and individuals and making any transactions in dollars. So-called sectoral sanctions against corporate titans such as Rosneft, Gazprom Group, Sberbank and VTB Group limit their ability to do business abroad. Restrictions added by President Joe Biden stop US financial institutions from participating in the primary market for Russian sovereign debt. "
"Australian Foreign Minister Senator Penny Wong announced additional sanctions against the Myanmar military regime on the third anniversary of the Myanmar coup last week. This move follows several months of robust advocacy efforts, notably highlighted by an open letter initiated by the Australian-based Myanmar Campaign Network (MCN) and addressed to the Foreign Minister in early November 2023.  The letter, endorsed by over 400 organizations, including UNI Global Union, identified more than 20 state-owned enterprises and entities within the banking sector that significantly contribute to the junta’s ability to finance its oppressive activities against the people of Myanmar.  Among the identified entities, the Australian government has chosen to impose sanctions specifically on the state-owned Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB). Three jet fuel suppliers were also included in the new sanctions."
"South Korea is the first country to sanction all the vessels but the New Konk and Unica. The two were sanctioned by the European Union in 2022.  The sanctions also apply to two North Koreans. Pak Kyong-ran, an employee of the Korea Paek Sol Trading Corp., is suspected of purchasing used vessels and bringing in refined oil into North Korea.  The second individual, Min Myong-hak, an executive at Risang Trading, is allegedly involved in the sending of North Korean workers and ship-to-ship transfers.  Along with Risang Trading, Mangang Trading Co. and Yua Trading were designated as the three entities subject to the sanctions."
"The European Union said on Friday it had agreed to impose sanctions against four people and two entities over violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.  The listed entities are Lehava, a radical right-wing Jewish supremacist group, and Hilltop Youth, the European Union Council said in a statement.  Two leading figures of Hilltop Youth, Meir Ettinger and Elisha Yered, are also listed, it added.  Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and the area has been under military occupation since, while Israeli settlements have consistently expanded. Palestinians envisage the West Bank as part of a future independent state also including Gaza and East Jerusalem."
"Global oil prices have spiked in recent week to over $90 per barrel on concerns about disruptions to global supplies after Iran called for an oil embargo on Israel over the conflict in Gaza. Prices eased on Thursday as fears of an embargo subsided.  Israel imports about 250,000 bpd of oil, mainly from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Iraq and African countries, according to Citi analysts in a note.  Sechin also said that it was important to increase the share of the rouble and yuan both in mutual payments between Russia and China and in settlements with third parties.  ""Of course, this requires the support of the Bank of Russia and the People's Bank of China, closer interbank cooperation and its practical focus on the implementation of specific projects,"" hew said according to Interfax."
"China slapped sanctions worth $20bn on Australian products during the height of diplomatic tensions in 2020, after the then-coalition government called for an independent inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic.  Sanctions worth $2bn remain on wine, rock lobster and some abattoirs.  Beijing is reviewing the trade ban on wine under a five-month process after Canberra agreed to suspend a dispute lodged with the WTO until March 31. During his meeting, Senator Farrell pressed for the removal of all remaining sanctions, AAP understands.  China lifted tariffs on barley in August last year through the same process, after Labor paused a WTO dispute in exchange for a review."
"China on Tuesday (Mar 23) said it summoned foreign diplomats in protest after the United States, the European Union, Canada and Britain jointly imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses in China’s far western Xinjiang region.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying called the new sanctions a ""slander and an affront to the reputation and dignity of the Chinese people"".   “I admonish them that they should not underestimate the firm determination of the Chinese people to defend their national interests and dignity, and they will pay the price for their folly and arrogance,” Hua told reporters at a daily briefing."
"Rights groups and United Nations experts have accused Myanmar's military of committing atrocities against civilians in its efforts to crush the resistance.  The junta says it is fighting terrorists"" and has ignored international calls to cease hostilities.  In 2021, French oil and gas group TotalEnergies and Chevron suspended some payments from Yadana that would have reached Myanmar's junta, earning praise from pro-democracy activists. TotalEnergies withdrew in 2022.  Justice for Myanmar, a non-profit group, said Chevron exited following sustained civil society pressure over payments from the gas project to the Myanmar junta.  Chevron said it has conducted its ""exit from Myanmar in a responsible, orderly and safe manner, in accordance with international law and trade sanctions.”"""
"The UN said on Tuesday (Mar 19) that Israel's severe restrictions on aid into war-ravaged Gaza coupled with its military offensive could amount to using starvation as a ""weapon of war"", which would be a ""war crime"".  United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk denounced the rampant hunger and looming famine in Gaza.  In a statement slammed by Israel, Turk said that ""the situation of hunger, starvation and famine is a result of Israel's extensive restrictions on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid and commercial goods"".  It was also linked to the ""displacement of most of the population, as well as the destruction of crucial civilian infrastructure"", he said."
"SINGAPORE: Southeast Asia need not worry about an immediate rise in terror attacks or recruitment of foreign fighters after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan. The bigger worry is if Afghanistan becomes a failed state under the Taliban, said Indonesian anti-terrorism expert Noor Huda Ismail.  “History has shown any conflict areas, any failed state, will become fertile ground for transnational terrorist organisations like ISIS or Al Qaeda to regroup. In the context of Southeast Asia, like what Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) did,” said Noor Huda, founder of the Institute for International Peace Building in Indonesia, in a one-on-one interview with CNA.  The JI, which had training camps in some of the region’s restive places, has been linked to terrorist attacks including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed hundreds of tourists and Indonesians."
"BUSAN, South Korea: The war in Ukraine has reached its second anniversary. On Feb 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his army into Ukraine in violation of repeated Russian assurances against invasion.  The war was to last a week or two. Mr Putin anticipated a “blitzkrieg” - a rapid victory which would present the West with a fait accompli. Before the West had time to react, the war would be over, and the West would have to adjust to new facts on the ground.  This quickly went awry. The Russian army bogged down in the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital and had to withdraw. In the east it penetrated along a broad front, but not deeply. It only took about 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory. Importantly, it did not reach the Dnipro River, which bisects Ukraine, and therefore could not approach North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) territory."
"The Taliban relied on brutal and excessive force to dominate much of Afghanistan from 1996–2001. The movement did not develop governance institutions that could provide for political representation — such as establishing a parliament — or perform basic state functions such as delivering social services to the people.  As a result of its repressive policies, it turned Afghanistan into a pariah state. It was only recognised by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  These countries saw the group as a proxy to limit the increasing influence of India, Iran and Russia, which were providing support to a coalition of anti-Taliban forces."
"MAE SOT, Thailand: A stream of people, some fearing air strikes, queued at a border crossing to flee Myanmar early on Friday (Apr 12), a day after the strategically vital town of Myawaddy near Thailand fell to anti-junta resistance that is gaining strength.  The loss of the town robs the junta, already grappling with an economy in free fall, of vital earnings from border trade while strengthening rebel groups such as the Karen National Union (KNU) that led the assault on Myawaddy, analysts say.  ""I am afraid of air strikes,"" said Moe Moe Thet San, a Myawaddy resident who crossed to Thailand with her son, who is about five years old."
"Following a push for cultural assimilation by the Thai government in the early 1930s and the introduction of Thai-centric practices, separatist movements were born among the ethnic Malay Patani, who found themselves struggling to preserve their lifestyle and traditions. Ever since, calls have been made for autonomy from the Thai state amid clashes between militants and Thai officers.  The violence remained relatively low key until 2004, when a group of insurgents broke into an army camp in Narathiwas and stole hundreds of firearms.  “The situation then was violent. People died every day and bomb attacks were constant. There was a lot of distrust among local civilians,” said Captain Boonsiang Kaewkoonjob from the Fourth Army – a military division that controls southern Thailand."
"Fighting between Myanmar's military and ethnic armed groups has rocked the border town of Myawaddy this week, sending people fleeing into Thailand, from where the boom of artillery shells and gunfire could be heard.  The conflict in Myanmar, sparked by the military's 2021 coup, regularly sends people rushing across the two countries' shared 2,400km border.  The recent clashes have raised concerns in Bangkok, with Thai Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara visiting the border on Friday.  ""Our soldiers are guarding along the border, showing we are ready to protect, and not let anyone violate our sovereignty,"" he told reporters.  ""Thailand has clearly stated that we will not allow anyone to violate Thai soil, we will not accept it,"" he said."
"BRISBANE: On Feb 1, it will be three years since Myanmar’s armed forces (known as the Tatmadaw) rejected the National League for Democracy’s 2020 landslide election victory and seized power. The country soon descended into a bitter and costly civil war that shows no signs of ending. Both sides have vowed to fight on until they achieve an outright military victory.  The multi-faceted and hydra-headed opposition movement is divided over many political issues, but in recent months it has managed to reach an unprecedented level of cooperation at the military level. Led by several ethnic armed organisations, this has resulted in joint and coordinated operations over two thirds of the country, and a string of military successes."
"MANILA: Islamic State militants claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing at a Catholic Mass in the Philippines on Sunday (Dec 3) that killed at least four people and injured 50 others.  The attack was carried out in a university gymnasium in Marawi, a city in the south of the country besieged by muslim militants for five months in 2017.  The Islamic State group, which wields influence in the country's south, said on Telegram its members had detonated the bomb.  Earlier on Sunday, before Islamic State's claim, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr condemned ""the senseless and most heinous acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists"". Police and the military strengthened security in the country's south and around the capital Manila."
"The Tahreek-e-Jihad Pakistan (TJP), which emerged earlier this year, said its members carried out Tuesday's attack.  Attacks by militant groups in Pakistan have been on the rise, particularly in its border regions with Afghanistan, after the hard-line Islamist militant group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) withdrew from a ceasefire last year.  Experts say the TTP have been emboldened by the Afghan Taliban, following the group's return to power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021.  Islamabad has claimed that insurgents operate from areas across the border. The Taliban in Afghanistan has repeatedly denied this.  The TTP, or Pakistan Taliban group, has been fighting the country's armed forces and police for years. The group shares the same hard-line ideology as the Afghan Taliban but is separate from it."
"BRIGHTON, England: The US and UK have over the past few weeks carried out a number of joint military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The strikes have been in response to attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels on both commercial and state vessels in the Red Sea since conflict broke out in Gaza on Oct 7, 2023.  The US and UK have justified their strikes by invoking the right of self-defence, as enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations’ charter. The same right is also found within customary international law.  Together, the two sources provide that the right exists “if an armed attack occurs” against a state and that any action taken should be both “necessary” and “proportionate”."
"WASHINGTON: The United States carried out retaliatory air strikes on Friday (Feb 2) in Iraq and Syria against more than 85 targets linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and the militias they back, the US military said, after a deadly attack in Jordan that killed three US troops and injured about 40 others.  The strikes are believed to be just the first in a multi-tiered response by President Joe Biden's administration in response to the attack last weekend carried out by Iran-backed militants.  While the US strikes did not target any locations inside Iran, they are likely to increase concern about tensions escalating in the Middle East from Israel's more than three-month-old war with Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza."
"The drone, which was launched at the Erbil air base by an Iranian-backed militia before sunrise on Oct 26, penetrated US air defences and crashed into the second floor of the barracks housing American troops at about 5am, according to two US officials familiar with the matter.  But the device laden with explosives failed to detonate and in the end, only one service member suffered a concussion from the impact, said the officials, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely about the attack. The US had got lucky, they added, as the drone could have caused carnage had it exploded."
"At least 18 pro-Iran fighters were killed in the strikes so far in eastern Syria, a war monitor said.  The US Treasury Department said it was imposing sanctions on six officials in the cyber-electronic command of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), over activities targeting critical infrastructure.  In a separate notice, the Treasury added that it was also hitting a network of suppliers providing materials and sensitive technology for Iran's ballistic missile and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) programmes"".  In a third measure, prosecutors also announced they had seized US$108 million used in an oil laundering scheme to fund the Revolutionary Guard's elite Qods Force."""
"JERUSALEM: Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant hinted on Tuesday (Dec 26) that the country had retaliated in Iraq, Yemen and Iran for attacks carried out against it as the war with Hamas-led Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip widens to other areas of the region.  We are in a multi-front war and are coming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria (West Bank), Iraq, Yemen and Iran. We have already responded and taken action in six of these theatres,"" he told lawmakers.  Since Gaza hostilities erupted with a cross-border Hamas rampage on Oct 7, the Israeli military has said it also retaliated for knock-on attacks from Lebanon and Syria, and carried out raids on Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank."""
"WASHINGTON: Twenty years after the United States’ invasion of Iraq, analysts say the conflict has drastically altered how the US views warfare, and has changed its boots-on-the-ground strategy.  The search for weapons of mass destruction (WMD), along with former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s purported ties with terrorist groups, was the pretext and justification for the campaign.  Then-US President George W. Bush called the military operation a mission to free the Iraqi people and to prevent Saddam’s regime from “(threatening) us with the world's most destructive weapons”.  “My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger,” said Bush on March 19, 2003, a day before the US-led invasion of Iraq."
"While one faction did not initially agree to Qaani's request, most others did. The next day, elite Iran-backed group Kataib Hezbollah announced it was suspending attacks.  Since Feb 4 there have been no attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria, compared to more than 20 in the two weeks before Qaani's visit, part of a surge in violence from the groups in opposition to Israel's war in Gaza.  ""Without Qaani's direct intervention it would have been impossible to convince Kataib Hezbollah to halt its military operations to de-escalate the tension"", a senior commander in one of the Iran-aligned Iraqi armed groups said. "
"What happened once they left? Local elections were held in East Timor and the two biggest parties – the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) and the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) – formed a coalition, but it did not last long. Fighting broke out, there was an attempted coup by UDT, and then Fretilin unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975.  What was Indonesia’s reaction? Indonesian forces had already secretly begun attacks across the border from Indonesian West Timor (on the other side of the island) in October 1975, where five Australian journalists were killed in the town of Balibo. Jakarta feared a communist state on its doorstep and that a newly independent country in its sphere could destabilise the rest of the archipelago. It launched a full-scale invasion of Timor in December 1975."
"Last Monday, the Sri Lanka Army 53, 58 and 59 divisions that led the assault on the final LTTE bastion reported that the LTTE leadership had been wiped out. By Monday, troops had identified the bodies of several prominent Tiger leaders; but were still searching for the body of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. Initial reports indicated that the body of Prabhakaran had been severely burnt as he had got caught in a massive explosion in the area while trying to escape in an ambulance.  On Tuesday, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 53 Division Major General Kamal Gunaratne called Army Commander Lt. General Sarath Fonseka (since promoted to General) who was at that time attending ceremonial sittings of Parliament where the President was declaring that the fighting had ended. He had called him to convey to his commander that his troops had recovered the body of the LTTE leader."
"Beyond Ethiopia, the threat of the Shabab, which seeks to establish an Islamic state, also looms large for Somalia.  The group remains a threat, targeting civilians and officials. In January, the Shabab captured a U.N. helicopter and took six passengers, including four Ukrainians, hostage, according to Ukraine’s foreign ministry.  The group also took responsibility for an attack this month that killed four Emirati and Bahraini security officers at a Mogadishu military base.  The Shabab remain potent even in the face of a large-scale, American-backed offensive that Mr. Mohamud’s administration launched when he came to power.  The group lost territory and soldiers in an initial phase of the campaign in central Somalia, experts and Somali officials say. Logistical and weather-related challenges have delayed a second phase aimed at clearing them from southern Somalia, Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur, the country’s defense minister, said in an interview."
"DUBAI: Yemen's Houthis said on Tuesday (Dec 12) they carried out a military operation against the Norwegian commercial tanker STRINDA in their latest protest against Israel's bombardment of Gaza.  The group said it hit the tanker with a rocket because it was delivering crude oil to an Israeli terminal and after its crew ignored all warnings, Houthi military spokesperson Yehia Sarea said in a statement.  However, the tanker's owner, Norway's Mowinckel Chemical Tankers, said the vessel was headed to Italy with a cargo of palm oil to be used in biofuels. It was not planning to stop in Israel, a company's spokesperson told Reuters.  The STRINDA had loaded vegetable oil and biofuels in Malaysia and was headed for Venice, data from shiptracking firm Kpler showed."
"Lebanon's army has taken control of a refugee camp in northern Lebanon that has been a refuge for Islamic militants since May, according to Lebanese officials.  The officials said the last area of Nahr el-Bared camp held by Fatah Islam fighters fell to the army after militants attempted a breakout from the camp over the weekend, which left 32 of them dead, bringing an end to three months of fighting. The army was also said to have caught 15 militants trying to escape.  Troops carried on searching for Fatah Islam fighters outside the camp in buildings, fields and roads, residents said. Before yesterday's battle, Lebanese officials had said up to 70 Fatah Islam fighters remained in the camp. When the fighting erupted in May, the number was estimated at 360."
"The Lebanese army's assault on Nahr el-Bared came a day after gunbattles which broke out after raids on houses of suspects linked to the Islamist group Fatah al-Islam. The suspects were accused of stealing tens of thousands of dollars in a bank raid. The fighting left 27 soldiers dead and more than a dozen militants.  The fighting is the deadliest internal violence in Lebanon since a 15-year war ended in 1990. Further south, a bomb was detonated in Beirut for the second successive night, wounding at least seven people and compounding the growing sense of instability in the country.  The US has backed the government of Fouad Siniora, the prime minister, saying the army operation in northern Lebanon was legitimate. ""Extremists that are trying to topple that young democracy need to be reined in,"" President George Bush told the Reuters news agency. But Mr Bush, though deeply distrustful of Syria's role in Lebanon, stopped short of accusing Damascus of involvement. ""I'll be guarded on making accusations until I get better information, but I will tell you there's no doubt that Syria was deeply involved in Lebanon. There's no question they're still involved,"" he said."
"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Saturday (Apr 24) recognised the 1915 killings of Armenians by Ottoman forces as genocide, a watershed moment for descendants of the hundreds of thousands of dead as he defied decades of pressure by Turkey.  Biden became the first US president to use the word genocide in a customary statement on the anniversary, a day after informing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he would go ahead with this step and seeking to limit the expected furor from the NATO ally.  We remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring,"" Biden said."""
"The Armenians of Karabakh, a territory internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but previously beyond Baku's control, were forced to declare a ceasefire on Sep 20 after a lightning 24-hour military operation by the much larger Azerbaijani military.  Our people do not want to live as part of Azerbaijan. Ninety-nine point nine per cent prefer to leave our historic lands,"" David Babayan, an adviser to Samvel Shahramanyan, the president of the self-styled Republic of Artsakh, told Reuters.  ""The fate of our poor people will go down in history as a disgrace and a shame for the Armenian people and for the whole civilised world,"" Babayan said."""
"YEREVAN: Azerbaijan said on Wednesday (Sep 20) it had halted military action in its breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh after its battlefield success forced Armenian separatist forces to agree to a ceasefire that will see the area fully return to Baku's control.  Under the agreement, outlined by Azerbaijan and the Russian Defence Ministry, which has peacekeepers on the ground, separatist forces are meant to disband and disarm, while talks on the future of ethnic Armenians who live there are due to start on Thursday.  In a speech to the nation on Wednesday evening, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said Baku had restored its sovereignty with an iron fist"" in a 24-hour offensive by troops backed by artillery strikes that brought the breakaway region to heel."""
"Thai and and Cambodian troops have agreed to a ceasefire, Cambodia’s government said, after a week of clashes that have killed at least 15 people in Southeast Asia’s deadliest border dispute in years.  On Thursday, both sides also agreed to re-open a border point near two disputed 12th-century Hindu temples to allow displaced people to return to their homes and villages, Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said.  “We will abide by the ceasefire from now on and local commanders will meet regularly to avoid misunderstanding,” he said. Fighting in the area had stopped after a brief morning clash, said Cambodian Colonel Suos Sothea."
"The peacekeepers had been in place since 2010 as part of efforts to resolve a dispute over the status of Dumeira Mountain and Dumeira Island, claimed by both Djibouti and Eritrea.  The tiny Dumeira Island lies just off the coast of the two countries, at the southern end of the Red Sea. It is close to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, an important shipping lane for global commerce.  The two countries' armed forces clashed on the border in 2008. Both states later accepted Qatar's offer of mediation and the deployment of peacekeepers, though bilateral relations have remained strained.  The withdrawal of the Qatari peacekeepers appears to be related to the country's current diplomatic dispute with some of its Gulf neighbours, which over recent weeks have imposed a blockade."
"Two Bangladeshi border guards have been shot dead by Indian troops near a frontier post, triggering an immediate protest by Dhaka, a Bangladeshi security official said today.  ""Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) suddenly started firing when our forces were patrolling along the northwestern frontier on Thursday night,"" said a spokesman for the Bangladesh Rifles border guards.  ""Two of our soldiers had been fatally hit. It's (a) serious violation by the BSF. We have lodged a strong protest with the BSF over the incident,"" he added.

"THAILAND'S SOUTHERN INSURGENCY  Generations of civilians in southern Thailand have been trapped in decades of deep-rooted conflicts and armed violence, which were reignited in 2004.  The area has been affected by more than 20,000 violent incidents ranging from bombings to gun attacks, according to Pattani-based conflict monitoring group Deep South Watch (DSW).  During the press conference, Mr Anwar expressed his optimism that the conflicts in Thailand’s southern border can be resolved through investments, trade and development.  “It is unfortunate because these small skirmishes have led to a lot of tension, some sort of resentment and distrust. So, we will have to appeal to all forces – both in Thailand and in the south, or even some in Malaysia – to understand and appreciate that peace must be a paramount consideration,” said Mr Anwar."

"Ex-BOJ board member criticises governor Ueda's market messaging  TOKYO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda must change his communication style that is confusing markets into believing an exit from ultra-loose monetary policy is imminent, former BOJ board member Takako Masai told Reuters.  Less than a year into the job, Ueda has already wrong-footed markets twice in comments about the policy outlook including on Dec. 7, when he elaborated on what the BOJ could do after ending its negative interest rate policy.  Bond yields and the yen surged on the comments, made in parliament, by fuelling market expectations the BOJ could end negative interest rates as early as in December. The BOJ made no change this month to its ultra-loose policy and dovish guidance."
"Environmental groups on Monday criticised Indonesian palm oil producer Astra Agro Lestari (AAL) over a third-party report investigating complaints against its subsidiaries' alleged abuses, saying it failed to investigate key issues.  Astra appointed EcoNusantara to review practices at three of its subsidiaries in March following allegations by environmental groups of human rights abuses and procedural violations.  One of the subsidiaries, PT Agro Nusa Abadi (ANA), was accused of seizing farmers' land in several villages covering approximately 5,000 hectares (12,355.27 acres).  “Despite international condemnation and consumer goods companies suspending sourcing from AAL over abuses in Sulawesi, the investigation did not bother to look at how AAL subsidiaries acquired lands from communities or whether these companies are operating legally,"" environmental group WALHI's Forest and Plantation Campaign manager Uli Arta Siagian said in a statement."

Democrat Schumer, long a supporter of Israel and the highest-ranking US Jewish elected official, told the Senate that Netanyahu's government ""no longer fits the needs of Israel"" five months into a war that began with attacks on Israel by Hamas militants on Oct 7.  ""As a democracy, Israel has the right to choose its own leaders, and we should let the chips fall where they may. But the important thing is that Israelis are given a choice. There needs to be a fresh debate about the future of Israel after Oct 7,"" Schumer said."
"Minister of State for Home Affairs Sun Xueling on Thursday (Feb 29) called out Meta's lack of cooperation with the Singapore government when it came to combatting scams.  Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has ""consistently pushed back"" against the Ministry of Home Affairs' (MHA) recommendations to put in place safeguards against scams on the social media platform, Ms Sun told parliament.  These recommendations include verifying users against government-issued IDs and offering a secured payment option for Marketplace users.  A total of 9,783 e-commerce scams were reported in Singapore last year, more than double the 4,762 cases the year before, with victims losing a combined S$13.9 million (US$10.3 million). Close to half of the scams were on Facebook, said Ms Sun."
"An Italian restaurant has apologised after it was criticised by Italy’s Ambassador to Singapore for trying to hold a mafia-themed night.  Gotti Italiano, which is situated in Amoy Street in Chinatown, had put up a Facebook post promoting the event, titled Hip Hop Mafioso, in the days leading up to the March 8 event. Its promotional poster featured American hip-hop artists Snoop Dogg and Tupac.  In a Facebook post on March 8, Ambassador Dante Brandi said that the mafia is not something Italy is proud of.  “People have died and suffered because of it and, most importantly...

"HONG KONG: China on Thursday (Feb 29) criticised British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and other foreign politicians for ""smearing"" an upcoming Hong Kong security law, as local authorities said feedback on the law had been largely positive.  The law, known as Article 23, will target crimes including treason, theft of state secrets, espionage, sabotage, sedition and ""external interference"", including from foreign governments.  A public consultation period on the proposed legislation ended this week, with the city's legislature, dominated by pro-Beijing lawmakers, expected to soon approve the draft laws.  The Hong Kong Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Thursday ""to express their strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition"" to British Foreign Secretary Cameron and other politicians' making ""irresponsible remarks"" on the legislation of Article 23."
"Erdogan has turned into one of the Muslim world's harshest critics of Israel's devastating response to the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas on Oct 7 last year.  He is angry at Washington for its support of how Israel is pursuing its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  The Turkish leader has compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and accused the United States of sponsoring the ""genocide"" of Palestinians.  He has also rebuffed US pressure to cut off the suspected flow of funding to Hamas through Türkiye, and defended the group as legitimately elected ""liberators"" fighting for their land."
"Taylor Swift took a 12-hour, 5,000-mile flight this weekend from Tokyo, Japan, to Las Vegas, Nevada, to watch Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce win the Super Bowl against the San Francisco 49ers. It was her latest private jet flight – a travel habit that has gained criticism due to the jet's inevitable release of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. The pop star allegedly produced 138 tons of CO2 emissions in three months while commuting to visit Kelce, Newsweek reported.   Why Taylor Swift's travel habits are being criticised  ""Swift's carbon emissions are extreme and are polluting the atmosphere,"" Leah Thomas, author of The Intersectional Environmentalist who studies the intersection between environmentalism and privilege, told BBC Travel.

This week, in the latest flare-up of newsroom tensions over the Israel-Gaza war, the freelance contributor to the Times ramped up her criticism of the newspaper for which she won journalism’s biggest prize, in interviews and social media posts saying she believes the Times coverage of the war has favored the Israeli perspective over the Palestinian. She also took aim at the Pulitzers, saying she felt as if the plight of Palestinian journalists and civilians was overlooked during speeches."
"Former President Donald J. Trump, who frequently paints himself as the fiercest defender of Israel to ever occupy the White House, on Wednesday criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a speech in Florida just days after deadly Hamas attacks rocked the country.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani, by an American drone strike in 2020.  Mr. Trump said that Israel had been working with the United States on a plan for the attack, but that he had received a call shortly beforehand to let him know that Israel would not take part. The United States proceeded anyway."

"Israel Football Association chief Moshe Zuares has criticised the English FA for its decision not to light up Wembley Stadium's arch in blue and white in solidarity with his country after last week's attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas.  Wembley, the home of England's national soccer team, has previously lit up its iconic arch with the colours of Ukraine, Turkey and other countries in solidarity.  But it will not do so for England's international friendly versus Australia on Friday nor Tuesday's European Championship qualifier against Italy, media reports said.

The announcement of the ban followed renewed scrutiny of LGBTQ rights in Malaysia after the government last month halted a music festival in Kuala Lumpur.  It pulled the plug after the frontman of British pop rock band The 1975 kissed a male bandmate onstage and criticised the country's anti-LGBTQ laws.  The discussion on LGBTQ rights also comes at a politically sensitive time in multi-ethnic, multi-faith Malaysia."
"Germany's health minister has criticised the Roman Catholic Church for its refusal to bless same-sex unions but says his religious faith remains strong.

Spahn described his relationship with the church as difficult at times, German news agency dpa reported Wednesday (Aug 18).  “My belief is deeply anchored inside of me,” dpa quoted Spahn as telling Germany's Bunte magazine. He added that as a gay man he was aware of “the many mistakes the church has made in its long history.”  “There are priests who bless guinea pigs and motorcycles,” Spahn said. “But two people who love each other and are believers wishing for a blessing for their promise to be there for each other all life long are being rejected by the church.”"
"SINGAPORE: OCBC should have “responded faster and more robustly” when it first detected signs of an SMS phishing scam in early December, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday (Feb 15).  The scam, which saw nearly 800 customers losing a combined S$13.7 million mostly over the year-end festive period, was “by far the most serious phishing scam” involving spoofed SMSes impersonating banks, he added in a ministerial statement in Parliament.  Mr Wong noted that OCBC, Singapore’s second-largest bank, took various actions throughout December to stem the phishing scam.  This included warning customers about the spoofed SMSes through general advisories on its website and later on through SMS and emails. The bank also worked with authorities to block and take down the scam websites and stopped sending SMSes with clickable links to customers, among other efforts."
"Croatian officials criticised NATO on Saturday (Mar 12) for what they said was its slow reaction to a military drone that apparently flew all the way from the Ukrainian war zone over several NATO member states, before crashing in an urban zone of the Croatian capital.  The Russian-made unmanned aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia and slamming late Thursday into a field near a student dormitory. More than 40 parked cars were damaged but no one was injured after a loud blast.  NATO said the alliance’s integrated air and missile defence had tracked the object’s flight path. But the Croatian prime minister said the country’s authorities were not informed and that NATO reacted only after question were posed by journalists.  “We cannot tolerate this situation, nor should it have ever happened,” Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said while visiting the crash site."
"Multilingual theatre company The Theatre Practice’s artistic director Kuo Jian Hong had said then that “no one theatre company can truly say it is ‘Singapore Theatre Company’”.

Rama Chandran, founder and director of children’s theatre company Act 3 Theatrics, who had taken to Facebook to criticise the name change, applauded STC’s Feb 8 announcement on the social media site.  Citing a diversity of groups across affiliation, language and art form which spoke up, he told ST that the episode “has been important for the theatre community in Singapore to find its voice and the belief that the voice will be heard”."

Hers was one of about 100 responses, many echoing Ms Nadillo, urging Mr Fernandes to clean up what they judged to be a personal misstep.   Mr Fernandes said he had just endured an 18-hour flight and was in pain, and that the massage was a spontaneous suggestion by somebody in the Indonesia operation. "
"The app removals sparked criticism from Indian companies, many of which have been at loggerheads with Google for years.  The dispute centres on efforts by some Indian start-ups to stop Google from imposing a fee of 11 per cent to 26 per cent on in-app payments after the country’s antitrust authorities ordered it not to enforce an earlier fee of 15 per cent to 30 per cent.  The start-ups have challenged Google’s policy in courts, including the Supreme Court, and before the antitrust watchdog.  “We believe that in the coming months, both the start-up community as well as Google would be able to come to a long-term resolution,” Mr Vaishnaw told Reuters partner ANI.  He had criticised Google’s decision to remove the apps on March 2, saying “it cannot be permitted”. REUTERS"
"Well-known commentator Hu Xijin – former editor-in-chief of state news outlet the Global Times – argued that in the current climate of mistrust between the United States and China, Western companies such as Apple “should give enough respect to the Chinese consumers”.  But he also reasoned that while “we should defend our national dignity and resist obvious malicious provocations; on the other hand, we should not indulge our sensitivities”.  Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  China is a critical market for the American tech multinational, accounting for 20 per cent of its total sales, as well as being its largest manufacturing base.  Apple lost about US$200 billion (S$272.4 billion) in market capitalisation over two days earlier in September on reports that China had banned its government officials from using the iPhone."

He also said the Government had a ""fiduciary responsibility"" to account for the losses.  Describing these statements as falsehoods, the Government said on its fact-checking website Factually: ""Mr Bowyer implies that the Singapore Government controls Temasek's and GIC's commercial decisions.

"Yet in China, the authorities under Xi Jinping, the country’s top leader, have brought a steely, uncompromising edge to their tactics for enforcing the Communist Party’s will.  Globe-straddling conglomerates have been leashed. A tycoon was disappeared into custody. In September, Ren Zhiqiang, a wealthy, politically connected property developer, was sentenced to 18 years in prison after he criticized Mr. Xi for the government’s handling of the coronavirus.  After Mr. Xi declared war on food waste this year, the official news media and video platforms turned against streamers who recorded themselves chowing down on extravagant spreads — a niche category of internet fame, but a remunerative one for its stars."
"While Dr Ko has not explicitly endorsed the Consensus, he has said people on both sides of the strait are “one family”.  Dr Ko is trying to play a finely calibrated game and distinguish himself from the KMT and DPP, said Assoc Prof Hoo.  “He tries to paint himself as a third force who can bring self-proclaimed new ideas into the policy and cross-strait space. He criticises DPP’s cross-strait position as reckless and risky, and the KMT’s position as being too conciliatory towards China,” he said. “He’s trying to carve out some kind of niche position or middle ground between the KMT and DPP – if there’s one that exists.”"
"China has not imposed any restrictions on trade with Russia, but the United States has threatened to blacklist companies round the world for violating its sanctions and warned Beijing against supplying Moscow with goods banned by U.S. export rules.  The customs information, drawn from one commercial trade data provider and cross-checked with two others, show some of the first evidence of Chinese trades with Russian-annexed regions of Ukraine since the war began on Feb. 24 2022.  The Chinese firm, Quzhou Nova, bought at least 3,220 tons of copper alloy in ingots worth a total of $7.4 million from the Debaltsevsky Plant of Metallurgical Engineering between Oct. 8, 2022 to Mar. 24, 2023, according to the data."

At present, Uruguayan beef, which constituted two-thirds of those exports to China, is subject to a 12 per cent tariff.  By comparison, other major beef exporters Australia and New Zealand, which have FTAs with China, pay tariffs at 3.3 per cent and 0 per cent.  Uruguay came close to signing an FTA with the United States in 2006, but its government at the time eventually rejected the deal over fears of expulsion from Mercosur if it did so.  According to a study conducted by the National Meat Institute of Uruguay in 2021, if China signs an FTA with Uruguay, the meat industry can implement a 0 per cent preferential tariff, which will reduce tariffs by $150 million."

Known as Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPA), the trade strategy is a key pillar of the UAE's economic growth plans as it seeks to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.  The agreement with Cambodia will reduce or remove tariffs, ""eliminating barriers to trade, and creating new avenues for strategic investment,"" Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE's minister for foreign trade tweeted.

"Trade between Russia and China is expected to hit a new record level of $200 billion this year, according to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin during his trip to China, as Moscow faces growing isolation from the West.  Russia has been hit by unprecedented Western sanctions since it unleashed a devastating war against Ukraine and has been shut out of much of the global economy.  But China, which has declared “no limits” to its friendship with its northern neighbor, has thrown the Kremlin an economic lifeline, tempering the impact of its banishment from the global financial system.  Last year, bilateral trade jumped nearly 30% to a record $190 billion, mainly boosted by China buying Russian energy. This year, their trade continued to surge, up 41% in the first four months, according to Chinese customs figures."
"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Cambodia have agreed on the terms of a bilateral trade deal, as the Gulf state looks to strengthen trade and commerce ties, particularly in Asia, in strategic economic sectors.  The two countries concluded negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), as the trade agreement is known, within six months of launch, according to a statement published by the UAE state news agency WAM.  Once implemented, the CEPA will eliminate many tariffs on Cambodian agricultural products, leather goods, and clothing and footwear while opening up a new market for the UAE's manufacturing and industrial sectors."

The agreement will also provide greater online protection for consumers and safe and secure cross-border payments. "
"Top officials from Indonesia and China discussed ways to improve their bilateral investment and trade, which include expanding the range of Indonesian exports products, both countries said on Friday (Sep 8).  Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang earlier on Friday after this week's East Asia Summit in Jakarta.  Li said in the meeting that China ""stands ready to expand the imports of Indonesian bulk commodities and premium agricultural and fishery products"", according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.  Jokowi also specifically invited Chinese firms, both private and state-owned, to participate in building Indonesia's US$32 billion new capital, Nusantara, according to a statement from his office."
"In recent years, both sides have also expanded their cooperation into new areas, including emerging ones such as climate change, renewable energy, and digital connectivity.  Economic cooperation between the two countries, which are heavily dependent on external trade, is strong.    In 2022, Singapore was Brunei’s fourth largest trading partner in goods. Singapore’s total trade in goods with Brunei was S$3.83 billion (US$2.86 billion) in 2022, an increase of 41.6 per cent from 2021.   “The empathy is there. Because we are both small states,” said Dr Alan Chong, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.   “Small states have to survive by being ‘eternally paranoid’ and vigilant. And this is where there are unquantifiable aspects to this special friendship.”"
"Mr Lee and Mr Chinh reaffirmed the longstanding friendship and excellent relations between Singapore and Vietnam, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a press statement.   ""Both leaders lauded the warm and frequent exchanges at the leader-to-leader, government-to-government, and people-to-people levels,"" MFA said.  ""They welcomed the substantive cooperation in trade and investment, security and defence, education and human resource development that has been built up over the years. They commended the role of the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs) in supporting Vietnam’s development since the launch of the first park in 1996, and looked forward to witnessing the ground-breaking and grant ceremonies for several new VSIPs."""
"The briefing was held at State House, Kenya's presidential residence in Nairobi.  Mr Lee noted that the economic cooperation between both countries has been on an upward trend.   “Kenya is one of Singapore’s important trading partners in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite COVID-19, bilateral trade in 2021 (has) increased by almost a quarter year-on-year,” he added.   Mr Lee added that several Singapore companies are already operating in Kenya in a variety of sectors from shipping to agribusiness.   A delegation of Singapore companies also accompanied Mr Lee and government officials to Kenya with the intention to pursue opportunities for investments and partnerships with Kenyan companies."
"The agreement was China’s first comprehensive bilateral FTA that it concluded with an Asian country, and was signed in 2008, said Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry.   Singapore and China signed the CSFTA Upgrade Protocol in 2018. Since it came into force in 2019, bilateral trade and investments grew at 7 per cent and 7.7 per cent per year on average respectively, added the ministry.   Singapore has been China’s largest foreign investor since 2013, while China has been Singapore’s top investment destination since 2007.   In 2020, negotiations were launched to upgrade the two countries' free trade agreement. These include more liberal and transparent rules to level the playing field for investors and service suppliers between both countries. "
"Bilateral merchandise trade between Singapore and Indonesia reached S$59.1 billion in 2021 – a 21 per cent increase from the previous year, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Wednesday (Jun 1).  MTI released the figures a day after Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong concluded his visit to Jakarta, during which he reaffirmed strong bilateral economic relations and opportunities for closer cooperation with Indonesia.  “Singapore and Indonesia share excellent bilateral economic relations. Indonesia is a key market for Singapore businesses looking to venture overseas,"" said Mr Gan, who was in Jakarta from May 29 to May 31."
"China's exports to Russia soared 136.4 per cent in March to a total of $9 billion, significantly faster than a 19.8 per cent growth registered in the first two months combined.  Imports from Russia rose 40.5 per cent to $11 billion, also faster than the 31.3 per cent increase in January-February.  The upbeat data on trade between the two countries comes amid slowing global growth. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its 2023 global growth forecasts to 2.8 per cent from 2.9 per cent, warning that financial system vulnerabilities could bring a new crisis.  During a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Russia in late March, he and President Vladimir Putin referred to each other as dear friends and promised economic cooperation."
"“It’s very hard to ignore the geopolitical background,” said Singh. “India is coming of age. And there’s some sense that this is a zero-sum game — that what China’s losing, India’s gaining.”  Western countries are courting India even though Modi has not turned his back on Russia, with his country importing more Russian oil and bilateral trade accelerating as the Ukraine conflict continues.  At the White House, new partnerships between the US and India in defence, space exploration and semiconductor manufacturing were inked last year.  One of the agreements allowed the sale of American-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones to India and for US-based General Electric to partner with Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft."
"A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said both sides also look forward to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which will enter into force on Jan 1, 2022.  The RCEP is the world’s largest trade pact, with the aim of lowering tariffs, opening up trade and promoting investments to help emerging economies catch up. It was first proposed in 2012 and signed last year by 15 Asia-Pacific nations, including Singapore and China.  Both Singapore and China have ratified the RCEP agreement.  PMO’s statement also noted that Mr Heng welcomed China’s application to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), in accordance with the CPTPP’s rules and procedures."
"The U.S. trade deficit in goods with South Korea increased from $13.2 billion in 2011 to $27.7 billion last year, according to U.S. government figures. The trade deficit for goods and services is smaller, at $17.5 billion. But it's grown faster, more than tripling from $5.4 billion in 2011.  Trump has ordered a wide-ranging review of America's deficits with top trading partners aimed at determining how much is the result of cheating, unfair practices and currency manipulation. South Korea is the U.S.'s sixth largest trading partner in goods.  Some economists have criticized the Trump administration's focus on trade deficits as a way of viewing U.S. economic ties with the rest of the world. They say it fails to take into account the complex patterns of global trade, pointing out that the U.S. has run big deficits during periods of strong economic growth."
"For years, the United States’ top trading partner has been China. That has now changed — Mexico is in top spot, as of last year.  It is the culmination of a trend that began during the Trump presidency, when tariffs were slapped on Chinese exports to the US.  It is also an example of the top trends in “de-risking” amidst all the geopolitical tensions: nearshoring or friend-shoring. Nearshoring means to locate production close to one’s consumers; friend-shoring is the policy of locating production in friendly countries.  In Mexico, the result is a manufacturing boom. One company that has grown, for example, is original equipment manufacturer Creation Technologies, whose customers include Fortune 500 companies."
"“This is immoral and unsustainable and ultimately affects the overall interests of the international community.”  The world’s two biggest economies used to be each other’s largest trading partners.  While both governments publicly oppose decoupling, China is now trading more with South-east Asia, and the US with neighbouring Canada and Mexico.  China has imposed exports curbs on a number of critical minerals, such as graphite – of which it provides 67 per cent of the global supply – citing national security concerns.  The US opposes export controls announced by China on gallium and germanium, metals used to produce semiconductors and other electronics."
"Singapore signed a ground-breaking free trade agreement (FTA) with four South American nations on Dec 8.  The deal with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – a group known by the Spanish acronym Mercosur – is Singapore’s first trade pact with these states and the bloc’s first such deal with a South-east Asian nation.  In January 2022, Singapore signed an FTA with another Latin American economic bloc called the Pacific Alliance, which comprises Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.  The agreement with Mercosur aims to facilitate greater trade flows through lowered tariffs and by establishing transparent investment conditions, noted Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Trade and Industry."
"But beyond the unusual swings in annual patterns in the last few years, trade data is beginning to provide compelling evidence that years of heightened tensions have significantly chipped away at the US’ trading relationship with China.  In 2023, US quarterly imports from China were at roughly the same level as they were 10 years ago, despite a decade of growth in the US economy and rising US imports from elsewhere in the world.  “We are decoupling, and that’s weighing heavily on trade flows,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said of the US and China.  Economists say the relative decrease in trade with China is clearly linked to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and then maintained by the Biden administration."
"Peru's trade with China doubled in the last decade to US$33 billion in 2022, driven by rising copper exports, even as its commerce flatlined with the United States. China has invested some $24 billion in Peruvian mines, the power grid, transportation and hydro-electric power generation over the same period.  Exports to China grew 9.3 per cent in the first eleven months of last year, government data show, faster than the 5.3 per cent growth of exports to the United States. Peru has a US$9.4 billion trade surplus with China and a US$1.3 billion deficit the United States.  Peru's President Dina Boluarte met China's Xi in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in San Francisco. They discussed the Chancay port, which Ms Boluarte said was a ""significant boost to free trade and new Chinese investments."""
"Erdogan, speaking at a Turkish-Iranian business council meeting alongside Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, blamed international sanctions on Tehran and the COVID pandemic for a decline in trade volumes.  Trade between Turkey and Iran peaked in 2012 at nearly $22 billion but has since fallen. It stood at $7.4 billion in 2023, according to Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat, down from around $10 billion a year earlier.  ""The issue of opening new border gates with Iran is also on our agenda. Efforts to establish trade centres in border (areas) to increasing the economic development of our border provinces continue,"" he said.  Turkey, a NATO ally, and Iran currently have four border crossings between them. One of those gates, between the Gurbulak-Bazergan regions, has been under construction since 2021."
"Speaking to members of the South Korean community, Mr Yoon said South Korea and Britain were partners that shared universal values of freedom, human rights and rule of law, and form an economic community through trade, Yonhap news reported.  Under Mr Yoon, South Korea has focused on strengthening economic, political, and military ties with the United States, a major ally, while seeking to maintain its trade with China and working to overcome historical disputes with long-time rival and fellow US ally Japan.  “With the resumption of the free trade talks, we will lay the basis for supply chain management and mutual cooperation,” he was quoted as telling the event in London, adding that the two countries would also expand cooperation in cyber security and defence industry."
"Similar opportunities to strengthen digital trade with China include an electronic data exchange system under the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement upgrade signed in 2018.  The Asean Single Window platform, which expedites Customs clearance between member states, could also be linked with partners like China, said Mr Gan.  He described Beijing's participation at the World Trade Organisation's Joint Statement Initiative for E-Commerce as a positive step in developing global digital trade rules.  Earlier, he noted that trade volume between the 10 Asean countries and China had increased by 7 per cent to US$730 billion (S$986 billion) in 2020, calling it ""a sign that trade between both sides continues to be robust, despite the impact of Covid-19""."
"Members of the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) have signed a fully-fledged free trade agreement with Iran, Russia's economy ministry and the EEU said on Monday.  The agreement will become permanent and replace a similar temporary pact in force since 2019. The previous deal facilitated mutual trade with Iran and increased it to $6.2 billion in 2022 from $2.4 billion in 2019.  The Eurasian Economic Union comprises Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.  Both the region and Iran have taken on additional significance for the Kremlin after Western sanctions over Moscow's conflict in Ukraine limited Russia's foreign trade routes and forced it to look for markets outside Europe."
"The proposal, mooted by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after his official visit to China in end-March, echoes similar calls made by a growing number of countries including China, Russia and India.  Around 80 per cent of Malaysia’s annual trade, totalling RM2.8 trillion (S$840 billion) in 2022, is denominated in US dollars. But Malaysia’s trade with the United States, its third-largest trading partner, amounts to only RM267.5 billion, representing 9.4 per cent of total trade.  China remained Malaysia’s largest trading partner in 2022, accounting for 17.1 per cent of Malaysia’s total trade. Singapore ranked second, with trade amounting to RM368.2 billion in 2022, according to data from Malaysia’s Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry."
"So, the fact that all these formalities can now be completed fuss-free and entirely online serves as an example of the potential for trade unleashed by a pioneering UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement, which made it all happen. And the implications of the new agreement go further, much beyond just encouraging better trade flows.  The latest statistics just released in London indicate that bilateral total trade between Britain and Singapore is just over £21 billion (S$35 billion).  While it is fashionable to claim that British trade continues to suffer due to the country’s withdrawal from the European Union, the reality remains that Britain’s exports to Singapore have expanded by a fifth over the past year."
"The EU-Asean economic ministers’ consultations decided last September to shift the focus towards cooperating in the specific sectors of the digital economy, green technologies and services, and supply chain resilience.  But not much has developed on that front, although the EU did sign bilateral trade deals with two Asean member countries. The EU-Singapore FTA entered into force in November 2019, and one with Vietnam became operational in August 2020.  However, separate investment protection agreements signed with both these nations are still awaiting ratification.  Negotiations with Indonesia are ongoing and talks with Thailand resumed recently, but discussions on trade deals with Malaysia and the Philippines are on hold."
"India and Russia are looking at ways to deepen trade ties, with Moscow viewing the South Asian country as an alternative market for its products in the face of crippling Western sanctions, while New Delhi hopes to reduce a widening trade deficit.  India’s imports from Russia increased five times to US$41.56 billion (S$55.6 billion) between April 2022 and February 2023 compared with the previous corresponding period, mainly due to oil imports, while its exports to the country have hit US$3 billion.  Russia, unable to sell to the West due to sanctions over the Ukraine war, has been selling oil at discounted rates to India and China."
"India was Australia’s second-largest export market for coal in 2020-21, according to government data. Australia’s coal trade with India vastly outstrips other exports in value and it is still growing.   But as the world moves away from fossil fuels, Australia should not trust its coal trade with India to remain strong, according to Dr Raghbendra Jha, professor emeritus at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy.  “Both India and Australia will be making very sharp and, right now, unpredictable changes in their energy mix,” he said.  Still, there are opportunities in the resources sector. Australia has 21 out of the 49 minerals that have been identified in India’s critical minerals strategy so there is a “perfect marriage in their efforts to de-carbonise their economies,” said Ms Lisa Singh, chief executive of Melbourne-based Australia-India Institute and deputy chairman of the Australian government’s Australia-India Council."
"Australia expects that ""technical"" issues disrupting trade with China will be resolved as soon as possible, deputy foreign affairs and trade secretary Christopher Langman said on Friday (Nov 13).  Ties with China, Australia's biggest trading partner, became frayed after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus, which erupted in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.  ""We've some real concerns about the growing pandemic issues that affect a range of Australian exports to China,"" Mr Langman said at the Caixin Summit in Beijing by video.  ""China has told us and said publicly that the current issues are technical matters. If that's the case, we expect that they will be resolved as quickly as possible so that any disrupted trade can be resumed."""
"The Union Bank of India has opened a special rupee vostro account with the India International Bank Malaysia (IIBM), and said in a statement that this will “help achieve better pricing for goods and services traded” and save on currency conversion.  Similarly, IIBM has opened a special rupee vostro account with the Union Bank of India, the Indian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur said in a press release.  Bilateral trade with Malaysia, the third-largest trading partner of India in Asean, was US$19.4 billion during 2021 to 2022.  In 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to allow the settlement of international trade in rupees to help push trade and make the currency international, in line with India’s growing aspirations as a global leader."
"Individuals and entities in Singapore are not allowed to conduct activities that violate our laws which give effect to the UNSCRs on the DPRK, said the Customs spokesman, referring to North Korea's official name.  ""We will investigate any wrongdoing by individuals or entities in Singapore, and will not hesitate to take action against those found guilty of wrongdoing.""  Singapore, like most Asean countries, has diplomatic ties with both Koreas. The 10-member bloc ranks among North Korea's major trading partners. Singapore was the North's sixth-largest trading partner in 2015, with bilateral trade reaching US$29 million (S$39.3 million). Thailand was the fourth-largest trade partner, after China, Russia and India."
"China's trade with North Korea rose in the first quarter in spite of tough new international sanctions this year targeting Pyongyang's banned nuclear programme, including curbs on coal imports.  Imports from the isolated country, consisting mainly of coal and clothes, rose 10.8 per cent from a year earlier, customs spokesman Huang Songping said on Wednesday (April 13).  China's exports to North Korea in the first quarter rose 14.7 per cent from a year earlier in yuan terms, Huang told a news conference. China is North Korea's only major ally and most important trade partner.  Exports consisted of electromechanical products, labour-intensive and agricultural products."
"The sanctions targeting four individuals and two entities related to North Korea’s weapons trade with three countries, including Russia, involve a Slovakian company, Versor S.R.O., and its chief executive, Mr Ashot Mkrtychev of Slovakia, it said.  The ministry did not provide details of the weapons trade.  The sanctions against the North’s defence minister and the chief of staff of the military are in response to the North’s nuclear and missile developments, the ministry said.  The move to impose sanctions comes after South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said it would be a “direct provocation” if Russia helped North Korea enhance its weapons program in return for help for its war in Ukraine."
"United States President Donald Trump signed a trade agreement on Wednesday (Jan 15) with China that is expected to boost exports from American farmers and manufacturers and is aimed at lowering tensions in a long-running dispute between the economic powers.  Mr Trump said during a White House ceremony that the deal is ""righting the wrongs of the past"".  He promoted the signing as a way of delivering economic justice for American workers and said: ""We mark a sea change in international trade"" with the signing.  The agreement is being described as ""phase one"" of a larger negotiation focusing on other tensions in the US-China trade relationship."
"The Indo-Pacific Business Forum is a key piece of this government-wide push, emphasising our role as the preferred commercial partner in the region, he was quoted as saying in a statement.  He said US investment in the region was US$866 billion (S$1.17 trillion) as at the end of last year, adding that this was far higher than that of China which stood at US$504 billion as of 2017, of which US$381 billion went to Hong Kong.  Overall US-Indo Pacific trade increased by almost 6 per cent last year to US$2 trillion, surpassing US trade with Europe at US$1.5 trillion and with South and Central America at US$1.2 trillion."
"The US trade deficit ballooned in August to its highest level in six months as exports of tariff-targeted goods fell while American consumers snapped up imported cars and mobile phones, the government reported on Friday (Oct 5).  With US imports of goods and services at their highest on record, the result pushed the goods deficits with China and Mexico to all time-highs, according to the Commerce Department report.  The total US trade deficit rose 6.4 per cent over July to US$53.2 billion (S$73.5 billion), overshooting analyst forecasts which called for a smaller five per cent increase. That was on record imports of US$262.7 billion and exports of US$209.4 billion."
"The initiative comes amid a steady stream of bilateral renminbi-denominated deals China has struck with trading partners, from Chinese oil purchases in the Middle East to commodities trade with partners from Brazil to Russia.  Beijing has retained close ties with Moscow despite the invasion of Ukraine.  The US dollar remains the dominant global currency, accounting for 42 per cent of global payments.  The renminbi’s share is just 2.29 per cent, but is up from 1.95 per cent two years ago.  A significant breakthrough in China’s efforts to promote use of the renminbi came this month, when Pakistan paid for its first government-to-government import of discounted Russian crude oil in renminbi."
"China's Foreign Ministry on Monday (Dec 18) defended trade with the United States as a win-win scenario ahead of a speech by US President Donald Trump laying out a new national security strategy that makes clear that China is a competitor.  Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping while also demanding that Beijing increase pressure on North Korea over its nuclear programme and changes in trade practices to make them more favourable to the United States.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said she was unable to comment on the strategy until it was unveiled.  But in principle, China hopes the strategy can play a constructive role in promoting world peace and stability and promoting China-US strategic mutual trust, Hua told a daily news conference."
"The Malaysian Cabinet is expected to review the country's trade with North Korea after both countries implemented travel bans.  International Trade and Industry Minister II Datuk Seri Ong Ka Chuan said trade with North Korea is expected to be discussed at the weekly Cabinet meeting on Friday (March 10).  Ministers will then decide whether or not the country will continue engaging North Korea in businesses.  ""At this moment, trade is still as it is unless Cabinet makes a decision. This is a very new development but we will have to make a decision on the issue,"" he told The Star when met in Cyberjaya on Tuesday."
"Apart from China, he said Malaysia has also successfully negotiated the use of the ringgit for trade with Indonesia and Thailand.  To a question from MP Wee Ka Siong, Mr Anwar said most government-linked investment companies and several local private companies have taken steps to conduct transactions in ringgit to increase demand for the currency.  “It will be very challenging for the ringgit if all transactions are done in US dollars, and that is why some companies are using up to 70 per cent of local currency for their transactions,” he added.  On the strength of the ringgit against the US dollar, Mr Anwar said it has nothing to do with fundamentals but more on the United States Federal Reserve’s moves to increase its overnight policy rates recently."
"Stranded North Korean workers and merchants who rely on cross-border trade see scant signs that the frontier with China will reopen soon, despite recent trips abroad by leader Kim Jong Un and the country’s athletes.  The bustling north-eastern Chinese city of Dandong has long offered a rare window into isolated North Korea and its trade with Beijing, its largest economic partner and benefactor.  But commerce ground to a halt in January 2020 when North Korea slammed its borders shut to insulate it from Covid-19 – marooning thousands of its citizens overseas.  Three years on, many still have not returned home."
"“The US’ lack of a comprehensive strategy to economically engage South-east Asia has provided China avenues to make significant inroads in terms of regional influence,” he said.  Over the past decade, Asean’s trade in goods with China more than doubled, reaching US$722 billion (S$974 billion) in 2022 and accounting for nearly one-fifth of the grouping’s global trade.   Since 2020, Asean and China have been each other’s largest trading partners, amid the signing of notable agreements like the Asean-China Free Trade Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.  In comparison, the US was Asean’s second-largest trading partner, with goods and services trade with it amounting to an estimated US$520 billion in 2022 after almost doubling over a decade."
"China and New Zealand on Wednesday signed a string of agreements designed to boost trade between the two countries, as their leaders met in Beijing for talks.  New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins is in China on a multi-day, multi-city mission to drum up business and help his nation exit an election-year recession.  After meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, Mr Hipkins’ charm offensive continued on Wednesday, when he met Premier Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People, greeted by a 48-strong band from the People’s Liberation Army.  Dialling down any criticism over China’s human rights abuses, tensions over Taiwan, and Beijing’s tacit support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mr Hipkins hailed the meeting as a reaffirmation of “important economic connections” between the countries.  “Our trading relationship is worth over NZ$40 billion (S$33 billion) annually,” Mr Hipkins said, stressing the need to “reaffirm the important economic connections we have with China”."
"The Indian dairy and agriculture sector is particularly concerned about a rise in imports from New Zealand and Australia under RCEP. The National Dairy Development Board has even recommended that the dairy sector be kept out of the purview of this deal.  ""The trade deficit between Asean and India has grown from US$8.1 billion (S$11.12 billion) in 2013-14 to US$21.9 billion in 2018-19 despite existing import tariffs. The deficit with China is around US$54 billion. Given this situation, we are concerned about how well our small and medium-scale industries will be able to compete if we bring in 80-95 per cent of the goods at zero tariffs,"" Mr Sharma added."
"The bridge was built for $3 billion (S$4 billion) under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to link the city’s European and Asian sides.  It adds to a series of potential deals between Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital.  The UAE pledged US$51 billion in July to support Turkey’s battered economy after Ankara and Arab Gulf states put aside years of animosity.  The UAE government, in a statement to Bloomberg, said it hoped bilateral trade with Turkey would double to US$40 billion by 2030 and that “key sectors” for investment included energy, logistics, tourism and agriculture."
"While Japan has maintained that the treated radioactive wastewater is well within international safety standards, Hong Kong said it is reasonable to be worried.  “We are taking a more conservative and safer approach, to assure Hong Kongers that all Japanese food imports are safe, and they can consume them with peace of mind,” said Hong Kong’s Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan.   “I think that’s the best measure for our Japanese restaurants as well as maintaining the relations between Hong Kong and Japan on food trading.”  On when Hong Kong will lift the ban, Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology (Food) Vivian Lau said: “There are a basket of factors that we consider, for example, if the discharge system claimed by Japan is working normally, and we will look at the radiation level of seawater and aquatic products."
"Singapore started importing renewable energy from Laos through Thailand and Malaysia on Thursday (Jun 23), after an initial two-year power purchase agreement was signed between Keppel Electric and Laos' state-owned Electricite du Laos (EDL).  The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) will import up to 100 megawatts (MW) of renewable hydropower using existing interconnections, marking the first multilateral cross-border electricity trade involving four ASEAN countries.  This is equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of Singapore's peak electricity demand in 2020, enough to power about 144,000 four-room HDB flats for a year.  This is also the first renewable energy import into Singapore, said Keppel Electric, EDL, the Laotian Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) in a joint news release."
"Nvidia identified Huawei as a top competitor in several categories, including artificial intelligence chips, for the first time in a filing with the Securities and Exchange commission late on Wednesday (Feb 21).  The Santa Clara, California-based company said that China's Huawei competes in supplying chips designed for artificial intelligence such as graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs) and networking chips.  The company also identified Huawei as a cloud service company designing its own hardware and software to improve AI computing.  Nvidia declined to comment on Thursday.  Huawei developed the Ascend series of chips as a rival to Nvidia's line of AI chips. The Chinese company's main product, the 910B chip, is its main rival to Nvidia's A100 chip, which launched roughly three years ago."
"Apple's iPhone sales in China fell 24 per cent year-on-year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint, as the US company faced increased competition from domestic rivals such as Huawei.  The US tech giant's chief competitor in China in premium smartphones, Huawei, saw unit sales rise by 64 per cent in the period, according to the report.  This could fan fears of a slowdown in demand for the US company, whose revenue forecast for the current quarter was US$6 billion below Wall Street expectations.  Shares of the iPhone maker were down 2.2 per cent in premarket trading on Tuesday and have lost about 10 per cent of their value so far this year, underperforming their big tech peers in the United States."
"Founded in 2005 by web developer Steve Huffman and entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, husband of tennis champion Serena Williams, Reddit has been backed by several marquee investors, from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz to China's tech behemoth, Tencent Holdings. Rapper Snoop Dogg is also an investor in the company.  Since being spun off from magazine conglomerate Conde Nast in 2011, Reddit became best known for its niche discussion groups and its users voting ""up"" or ""down"" for content other members posted.  It has made efforts in recent years to freshen its appeal among younger users through its acquisition of TikTok competitor Dubsmash in 2020."
"Telenor shares were down 1.9 per cent at 0829 GMT, lagging a flat Oslo benchmark index.  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 8 per cent year-on-year to 13 billion crowns, in line with an analyst forecast of 13.1 billion crowns.  Telenor reiterated full-year guidance for overall organic revenue and earnings to remain unchanged year-on-year from 2020, excluding the Myanmar impact. It repeated that capital expenditure would amount to between 15 per cent and 16 oer cent of sales.  The company, which serves 187 million customers in nine countries across Europe and Asia, a net gain of 5 million since the start of the year, last month announced plans to merge its Malaysian unit with competitor Axiata, seeking to form a new market leader.."
"“The wording is such that it is kept ambiguous enough and vague enough as a report card, but also to reserve certain spaces in order to maneuver in the international environment that China is finding itself in, particularly the dynamics of the environments,” said Dr Lim.    There are also external forces which even China as a superpower cannot control, said Dr Lim, including the COVID-19 pandemic, potential global recession, and the upcoming US mid-term election as China continues facing tensions with the West.    The Biden administration had released a National Security Strategy last week that focused on outcompeting China and restraining Russia.    It highlighted China as “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do it”."
"The fare increase has attracted negative reactions from some customers concerned with the timing of the fare increase – in the middle of Singapore’s battle with a second wave of infections.  Grab’s S$1-a-ride assistance to drivers also pales in comparison with enhanced rental rebates supported by the S$27 million top-up to the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund from May 16 to end-June.  Interestingly, ComfortDelGro, Grab’s closest competitor, seized the opportunity to assure its customers that it was not increasing its price.  In fact, Comfort tried to score points by emphasising it was giving as much as 50 per cent rental rebates until Jun 13,, the possible end date of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)."
"Huawei has repeatedly said it does not make cars on its own but only helps other automakers make better vehicles.  It has an existing partnership with Changan as well as other companies, including Seres Group. Huawei and Seres jointly produce Aito branded cars, including the M7 model.  Huawei has also built the S7 sedan with Chinese automaker Chery under a new marquee, Luxeed, that it intends to position as a competitor to Tesla's Model S.  Huawei said in October it had received more than 50,000 orders for its revamped M7 model during the first 25 days of sales, which would put Aito among China's five top-selling new energy vehicle manufacturers based on August data."
"EXPONENTIAL GROWTH  China's onshore hedge funds have seen exponential growth in the past decade, with 6 trillion yuan of assets under management, according to UBS research.  Qianxiang's bigger competitor Lingjun Investment, which manages more than 60 billion yuan, formed a Hong Kong marketing team and launched its first offshore quant fund late last year, according to regulatory filings and sources.  Star asset manager Foresight Fund Management, a Shanghai-based mutual fund founded by veteran investor Chen Guangming, announced the opening of its Hong Kong branch in March.  Erin Wu, head of investor relations at OP Investment Management, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund platform that provides services to new funds, said she has received more inquiries this year than before the pandemic. Wu is talking to more than 10 China-based managers on preparing an offshore structure."
"OTHER EUROPEAN CAPITALS WATCHING CLOSELY  “Germany is overexposed to foreign demand, particularly in China. What we see right now is that China's demand is slowing and German exports to China are slowing, and so Germany is not doing so well,” Dr Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told CNA.   “(Increasingly), China is a competitor to German industry and so the big task for Germany is to create other growth motors beyond China, in Europe and other markets. And that's a very challenging task.”  Now, other European countries are closely monitoring Germany’s economic situation. "
"The firm plans to introduce more services here in addition to its private-hire car and taxi booking services over the ""next few months"". He declined to give more details, saying more would be revealed once launch dates are confirmed.   Like its main regional competitor Grab, Gojek offers a slew of services ranging from food and grocery deliveries to financial services in its native Indonesia, though these have yet to be introduced in Singapore.   In 2019, then Gojek co-chief executive Andre Soelistyo said the firm plans to eventually offer such services in Singapore, but was taking a cautious approach to doing so."
"The European Union still lacks ""very clear evidence"" of unfair practices to launch a formal probe into China's wind power industry that has become a cut-price competitor to Europe's, an EU official said.  In a leaked wind energy proposal last week, the Commission said it would scrutinise foreign subsidies as part of a broader action plan to support its struggling wind industry that is fast losing its leadership position.  The EU official said China feared the EU would immediately look at punitive measures on its wind and hydrogen electrolyser industries after the surprise probe on its automakers.  ""The announcement of the investigation on the EVs (electric vehicles) was a bit of a shock because it was announced in such a political speech and a change of tune from traditional openness. China interpreted it as a foregone conclusion that they were already taking measures,"" the official said."
"Prosecutors stopped short of stating a connection between the Israeli private eye – former policeman Aviram Azari – and Exxon, and the memo did not identify any of his clients. Victims say that leaves a key question unanswered.  ""While it's satisfying to see Azari sentenced for these crimes committed many years ago, we would still love to know who paid him to target me and my climate activist and lawyer colleagues,"" said Kert Davies, one of Azari's victims and the director of investigations at the Center for Climate Integrity.  Exxon has previously denied having any connection to the Israeli or his hacking campaign.  The oil company, which has come under increased scrutiny following its just-announced $60 billion deal to buy competitor Pioneer Natural Resources, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Exxon's lawyers in the case, Paul Weiss, also did not respond to an email seeking comment."
"While Hyundai's plan for an IPO later this year is not finalised, it could potentially be the country's biggest stock market offering, the sources said.  The company is exploring ""value unlocking for its India business"" through the IPO, the two sources said.  A spokesperson at Hyundai's India unit declined to comment.  Hyundai, India's second-largest carmaker by sales, has said it plans to invest US$2.45 billion in the country for its electrification push with plans to launch new EVs, charging stations and a battery pack assembly unit.  The carmaker, which entered India more than 20 years ago, has 15 per cent share of the Indian car market and competes with Maruti Suzuki and local rival Tata Motors"
"Trade between Russia and China soared 30 per cent in the first half of this year and will rise to more than US$200 billion in 2023, Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on a visit to China.  ""We are actively developing investments, including in our large gas and petrochemical projects, where we actively use Chinese technologies,"" Reshetnikov said.  ""We are strongly interested in transforming technological cooperation into investment cooperation, so that Chinese companies actively enter into these projects, invest in capital, and lend money, because the projects are capital-intensive and not all of them can be fully provided for by the Russian financial system.""  The United States sees China as its gravest long-term ""strategic competitor"" and Russia as an ""acute threat""."
"Grab intends to digitalise Trans-cab’s booking services so that taxi drivers receive bookings from both the Grab platform as well as Trans-cab’s existing call centre. This will increase productivity (and earnings) for taxi drivers that used to wait mainly for customers via street hail or the call centre. And for Grab, the increased supply of vehicles and full-time drivers will alleviate some of the pent-up customer demand.  How about concerns of a potential monopoly? ComfortDelGro remains a formidable competitor for Grab in Singapore, with 64 per cent market share compared to Trans-cab’s 15 per cent. The LTA’s point-to-point transport regulatory framework also does not allow ride-hail operators to prevent drivers from using other platforms.  If ComfortDelGro could make significant enhancement of its technology, particularly in mapping and search, it would strengthen its competitive position significantly."
"The compromise plan will involve several stages before a second network is set up to operate alongside state-owned Digital Nasional Bhd (DNB), which will also be taken over eventually by the private sector, according to industry executives close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.  In a nutshell, the architects of the plan are hoping that the country’s private mobile network operators (MNOs) would come together to form two separate consortiums: one taking over ownership of DNB and the other rolling out a separate network that could see a new technology partner, with possibly China’s Huawei emerging as a player in the country’s 5G rollout.

"China has cancelled a trip by European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell scheduled for next week, an EU spokesperson said on Tuesday (Jul 4). No reasons were given for the cancellation, which comes as Europe seeks to reduce risks created by its close economic relationship with China, which Brussels has dubbed an ""economic competitor and a systemic rival"".  ""Unfortunately, we were informed by the Chinese counterparts that the envisaged dates next week are no longer possible and we must now look for alternatives,"" spokesperson Nabila Massrali told Reuters in a written statement on Tuesday.  A spokesman for China's foreign ministry declined to say why this visit was cancelled when asked at a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, but did not write off hopes of another attempt at a visit."
"Paytm competes with players such as Google Pay and Walmart's PhonePe in India, where digital payments gained traction after the country banned some high-value currency notes in 2016. Merchants from vegetable vendors to large retail stores now accept digital payments.  The focus is to add as many merchants as possible and engage with them, riding the popularity of soundbox, Sharma said.  Paytm shares ended little changed on Monday, trimming some earlier losses. The stock has rebounded sharply from November lows after the company reached operational profitability ahead of schedule, but is still about 60 per cent off its IPO issue price of 2,150 rupees."
"Sea's e-commerce arm Shopee brought in US$922 million in revenue, up 250 per cent year-on-year, while its gaming arm Garena raked in US$781 million in revenue, up 111 per cent on the year.   Li told reporters that Shopee was seeing growth in Brazil due to a nascent regional expansion. Reuters reported earlier in 2021 that the firm was launching in Mexico and was eying a possible wider expansion in Latin America.   Analysts said they believe the jump in marketing costs was also due to Shopee's launch of a food delivery arm segment in Indonesia this year, where it now competes with ride-hailers Grab and Gojek.

"The lender's net interest margin of 1.70 per cent was squeezed by 2 basis points compared with the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in customers migrating their deposits to term products, particularly in Asia.  In the third-quarter results, the lender booked a US$500 million impairment related to the commercial real estate sector in mainland China.  ""We continue to monitor risks related to our exposures in mainland China's commercial real estate sector closely, and there remains a degree of uncertainty in the forward economic outlook, particularly in the UK,"" the company said in the results statement.  HSBC's Asia-focused competitor Standard Chartered reported last week an unexpected one-third plunge in third-quarter profit due to a nearly US$1 billion combined hit from its exposure to China's real estate and banking sectors."
"“Chinese futures market is incredibly deep, liquid and different,” Razvan Remsing, director of investment solutions at Aspect Capital, told Reuters last week.  He said futures on industrial commodities such as PTA, Polyethylene, PVC or fertilizer in the form of soda ash and urea or inputs into construction like glass, have no western equivalent markets. Thus the global pricing on these commodities is set in China.  So far this year, trend-following quant funds that typically are machine-driven and trade across equities, bonds, commodities, have done well in China even as its equities market slumped to a five-year low.  Aspect’s competitor, U.S. quant fund Two Sigma Investments, saw its CTA (commodity trading advisers) fund in mainland China jump 10 per cent for the first 10 months, according to an investor letter seen by Reuters. Two Sigma declined to comment. "
"The debate over who should foot the bill for increased traffic usage has seen global technology giants clash with local internet providers in South Korea.  Earlier this year, Netflix and South Korean internet service provider SK Broadband withdrew lawsuits against each other over network usage fees.  In 2022, Twitch limited video resolution in South Korea, a country with a booming esports scene and use of online videogames, citing growing operating costs.  Shares of Afreeca TV, a South Korean streaming platform and competitor, closed up nearly 30 per cent on Wednesday following the announcement.  Twitch had laid off more than 400 employees in March after its user and revenue growth did not meet expectations."
"The German cabinet is to pass its long-promised China strategy on Thursday (Jul 13), two government sources told Reuters on Wednesday.  Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government last year ordered a rethink on how Germany interacts with China, its biggest trade partner but also viewed by Berlin as an increasingly assertive competitor and strategic rival.  Scholz has repeatedly emphasised ""derisking"" Germany's relationship with China, thereby reducing dependencies on the country gradually rather than decoupling from the Chinese market.  Among the changes under consideration is the screening of investments by German companies doing business in China to protect the flow of sensitive technology and know-how."
"Receiving General Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin sent his best wishes to Xi, saying the two leaders had developed a good friendship and working relations.  ""Russia and China are not building any military alliances along the lines of the Cold War,"" Putin told Zhang at his Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, adding that the Russian-Chinese relationship was a stabilising force for the world.  The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat while US President Joe Biden argues that this century will be defined by an existential contest between democracies and autocracies."
"European Union ministers on Friday (May 12) backed reducing the bloc's economic dependence on China but will now have to figure out how to make that a reality, foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.  Borrell said foreign ministers gave broad backing to a plan to adjust policy on China to place greater emphasis on its role as a political rival, while continuing also to see Beijing both as a partner on global issues and an economic competitor.  ""Colleagues welcomed the paper that we presented. They agree on the basic lines of this re-calibration of our strategy on China,"" Borrell told reporters after their meeting in Stockholm."
"Ford Motor Co CEO Jim Farley said on Thursday (May 25) Chinese electric vehicle makers are its main rivals in the sector, but the company has hurdles competing on cost at a smaller scale.  ""I think we see the Chinese as the main competitor, not GM or Toyota,"" Farley said at the Morgan Stanley Sustainable Finance Summit. ""The Chinese are going to be the powerhouse.""  China, the world's largest auto market, has some of the best battery technology and dominates EV production, Farley said. He cited BYD, Geely, Great Wall, Changan SAIC as among the ""winners"" among Chinese automakers.  To beat Chinese automakers, Farley said Ford needs distinctive branding, which he believes it has, or lower costs. ""But how do you beat on them on cost if their scale is five times yours?"" Farley said. ""The Europeans let (Chinese automakers) in - so now they are selling in high volume in Europe."""
"Most directors would be thrilled to have one film shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Wim Wenders has two.  ""Perfect Days"" - the German auteur's 10th contender for the festival's top prize - is sharing the programme with a special screening of ""Anselm"", his 3D study of German artist Anselm Kiefer.  The films are worlds apart in subject matter, but one led to the other. Wenders told Reuters in an interview he had time on his hands during post-production on ""Anselm"" so decided to visit Japan.  ""And before I knew it, we're making a movie in Japan,"" he said.  The result, ""Perfect Days"", premiers on Thursday, starring acclaimed Japanese actor Koji Yakusho as a toilet cleaner in Tokyo."
"A man who struck Malaysian actor Kamal Adli at Singapore Expo last year was jailed for 28 months' and two weeks on Thursday (Apr 25).  Muhammad Nabil Rashid used an extendable baton to strike the actor at a meet-and-greet session in March 2023.  He claimed he attacked Kamal as he wanted to take revenge for a purported act of molest by the actor on a relative.   Nabil, a 34-year-old Singaporean, has been deemed by an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist to suffer from a psychotic illness, likely delusional disorder of a persecutory subtype. The psychiatrist felt that Nabil also had antisocial personality disorder."
"“Fascinated”, “impactful” and “obsessed” were the words Mr Akihiro Takahashi used to describe his first experience of eating bak kut teh.  That happened three years ago when the 43-year-old was in Singapore for a business trip. He had visited Founder Bak Kut Teh and it was love at first bite.  “I was fascinated by how delicious it was … The taste was impactful,” said the low-profile Japanese, who declined to be photographed for this interview. “At the start, bak kut teh looks like a very simple dish but in just one mouthful, you can taste pepper, garlic and the juiciness of pork meat.”"
"I don't know which was worse: The smell or the creepy crawlies. The stench of rotting food was like vomit mixed with dank, dirty laundry. I struggled not to retch. Then there were the bugs which scuttled everywhere as I bent down to pick up the trash.  Such working conditions are the norm for Zuwel, a Bangladeshi worker who clears trash from 29 blocks in Bukit Panjang every day.  I stepped into his shoes for a couple of days last month, labouring in the sweltering heat and dashing from one rubbish chute to another in an electric cart to empty the bins.  According to a 2012 World Bank report, each person in Singapore generates 1.49kg of municipal waste every day. This figure – on par with Malaysia, but higher than Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea – is expected to grow to 1.8kg by 2025."
"When he first arrived in Singapore as a fresh-faced teenager a little over seven years ago, the sum of Song Ui-young's English vocabulary totalled just two words.  “I couldn’t speak English - I only knew 'yes' or 'no',"" said the South Korean footballer.  But the 18-year-old Yeouido High School student was nonetheless determined to at least do his talking on the pitch.  ""My coach in Korea knew the then Home United coach, Lee Lim Saeng, and recommended me to him. Then coach Lee came down to watch my game and he just liked me,"" said Song.  “After that we talked and he asked me to play in the (reserve) Prime League first. I thought if I could adjust in Singapore, then maybe I could step up and have the chance to play in the S.League (now Singapore Premier League).”"
"Indonesia's Rahmat Erwin Abdullah set a weightlifting world record and China's world-beating teenage divers wowed fans, but their soccer players crashed out on day 10 of the Hangzhou Asian Games on Tuesday (Oct 3).  Abdullah secured gold with a lift of 201kg in the men's 73kg clean and jerk, which beat the previous record of 200kg which he set last December.  The 22-year-old's lift follows three other world records set by North Korean weightlifters at this Games.  ""I had a pretty good performance, but I was still not at my maximum,"" Abdullah said. ""I always empty my mind every time I lift. I wanted to just focus on my clean and jerk, nothing else."""
"The arrival of Israeli keeper Daniel Peretz at Bayern Munich is an investment for the future and not merely a stopgap signing while Manuel Neuer returns to full fitness, club CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen said on Monday (Aug 28).  Bayern signed Peretz from Maccabi Tel Aviv on a five-year deal on Friday, the 23-year-old becoming the first Israeli player to sign for the club.  Neuer, 37, remains sidelined after breaking his leg while skiing in December and while the Germany international has started individual training a return to action still looks weeks away.  With goalkeepers Yann Sommer and Alexander Nuebel leaving in the summer, Bayern have had to turn to 35-year-old Sven Ulreich for their first two league matches of the season, both of which have been victories."
"Su Haijin, a 40-year-old Cyprus national, arrested in a GCB along Ewart Park in the Holland area. Charged with one count of resisting lawful apprehension.  Vang Shuiming, a 42-year-old Turkiye national, arrested in a GCB along Bishopsgate in the Tanglin area. Charged with one count of using a forged document.  Zhang Ruijin, a 44-year-old China national and Lin Baoying, a 43-year-old China national, arrested in a bungalow along Pearl Island at Sentosa Cove. Both charged with one count each of forgery for the purpose of cheating. Su Baolin, a 41-year-old Cambodia national, arrested in a GCB along Nassim Road. Charged with one count of using a forged document.  Su Jianfeng, a 35-year-old Ni-Vanuatu national, arrested in a GCB along Third Avenue near Bukit Timah. Charged with one count of money laundering.  Chen Qingyuan, a 33-year-old Cambodia national, arrested in a condominium along Leonie Hill Road in the River Valley area. Charged with one count of money laundering."
"Russian businessman Alexander Nakhapetov has been a regular at the “banyas” in his adopted home of Phuket ever since several of the traditional steam baths opened last year.  Lately, though, the 41-year-old’s routine has been disrupted by an influx of his countrymen to Thailand’s biggest island — which has resulted in those new bathhouses being booked out much of the time.  While Phuket has long attracted Russia's wealthier citizens, the influx is accelerating as Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine makes competing destinations in Europe and elsewhere harder to enter.  The number of villas sold on the island last year surged 82 per cent to 338, about half of which were purchased by Russians, according to real estate agency Knight Frank Thailand. Enterprises from restaurants to saunas and concerts have sprung up appealing to the new clientele."
"Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kyle Anderson has obtained Chinese citizenship through naturalisation, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) said on Monday (Jul 24).  The 29-year-old forward from New York is the latest elite athlete to gain Chinese nationality through naturalisation and the first basketball player to do so.  ""(Anderson) obtained Chinese nationality this morning and met Yao Ming, chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association,"" the CBA said in a post on its official Weibo account.  Citizenship could potentially allow Anderson to play for China at the FIBA World Cup that tips off on Aug 25 in the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia, as well as at the Olympic Games in Paris next year."
"Romanian prosecutors sent social media influencer Andrew Tate, his brother Tristan and two other suspects to trial on Tuesday (Jun 20) on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.  The Tate brothers and two Romanian female suspects are under house arrest pending a criminal investigation into abuses committed against seven women - accusations they have denied.  The brothers, former kickboxers who have United States and British nationality, are the highest profile suspects to be sent to trial for human trafficking in Romania.  Tate has millions of online fans, mostly young men, who follow his promotion of an ultra-masculine, luxurious lifestyle. Critics accuse him of misogyny."
"An Egyptian man in Singapore for a conference herded two women into a lift at Marina Bay Sands and molested one of them, before lifting his shirt and insulting her modesty.  Wael Mohamed Abdelmagid Ibrahim Kandil, 38, pleaded guilty on Monday (Sep 25) to one count each of molestation and insulting a woman's modesty.   A third count of using criminal force by pushing the victim into the lift will be considered in sentencing.  The court heard that Wael was the director of sales for Simply Gourmet, a company based in the United Arab Emirates.   He was in Singapore for a week in April 2023 for a conference.  At about 3am on Apr 29, a 36-year-old Vietnamese woman and a 39-year-old Singaporean woman were at the entrance to a lift lobby outside restaurant and bar Ce La Vi on the 57th floor at Marina Bay Sands."
"Visiting unique sites for work is de rigueur for architects, but how many can say they have trekked the Himalayas as research? This is what Goy Zhenru did in 2023 after her firm Goy Architects was engaged to refurbish the iconic Hotel Everest View – the only hotel in the world’s highest mountain range where every guestroom has a view of Mount Everest and neighbouring alabaster peaks.  “I had received a call from Sonia Miyahara asking if we would like to work on the hotel’s refurbishment. I immediately jumped and said yes to a Zoom call,” recalled Goy. Nepali architect Manish Kayastha had seen one of her projects in a magazine and recommended the firm to Miyahara. Hotel Everest View was developed in the 1970s by Miyahara’s father, the late Takashi Miyahara and designed by Japanese architect Yoshinobu Kumagaya. It is situated on Syangboche in the Kumbu region of Nepal, within the Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park – a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  “The hotel offers 360-degree views of the Himalayas mountain range that includes Mount Everest at 8,848m above sea level. Miyahara, who previously worked in Singapore, had returned to Nepal to help with the family business. It was her aspiration to make Hotel Everest View one of the best mountain hotels in the world,” shared Goy."
"Starting a new restaurant can be a lengthy affair. You might find yourself waiting for the perfect space to come along, or for the relevant permits to come through. What to do while waiting for the pieces to fall steadily into place?  In Italian chef Mirko Febbrile’s case, you use some of that time to bring a taste of Italy to a Chinatown hawker stall for a month-long pop-up.  The former chef de cuisine of Italian restaurant Braci, under whose helm it earned a Michelin star, joined the Lo & Behold Group in September 2021. Plans are underway for two restaurants to come under his lead, but until that happens, Febbrile keeps busy laying the foundations of his new establishments which he says are grounded in “inclusivity and authenticity”. It is a philosophy inspired by his native Puglia and by the openness and generosity that Singapore has shown him."
"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said it has invited British billionaire Richard Branson to Singapore for a live televised debate with its minister K Shanmugam on the country's approach towards drugs and the death penalty.   Mr Branson has been vocal in his views against Singapore's death penalty for crimes such as drug trafficking, most recently in a blog post on Oct 10. Earlier this year, he spoke out against the execution of convicted drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam.  In response to his blog post, MHA said in a media release on Saturday (Oct 22) that he made false assertions about alleged racial bias and the treatment of defence lawyers.   The ministry also reiterated Singapore's stance on drugs, saying that the capital sentence has had a clear deterrent effect on drug traffickers in Singapore."
"Do you hear that? It’s the sound of hearts breaking when it was revealed that Song Joong-ki is in a relationship. And get this: The Vincenzo actor apparently made it official right here in Singapore.  It was reported by Allkpop that Song introduced his girlfriend to the staff members at a media conference held on Dec 7 in Singapore.  If the records are correct, it could be at The Coliseum at Hard Rock Hotel at Resorts World Sentosa, where he was in town to promote Reborn Rich.  The South Korean actor is no stranger to Singapore, having made eight trips, by his own count, to the sunny island over the years.   South Korean websites Soompi and Allkpop reported that he is seeing a British woman. His agency HighZium Studio confirmed on Dec 26 that Song is indeed dating, though it did not mention her nationality."
"Film director Paul Haggis was detained on Sunday (Jun 19) for investigation of allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in southern Italy, Italian news media said, quoting local prosecutors.  The Canada-born, Oscar-winning Haggis, 69, has been in Italy for a film festival that begins on Tuesday in Ostuni, a tourist town in Puglia, the region that forms the “heel” of the Italian peninsula.  The news agency LaPresse and several other Italian media carried a written statement from prosecutors in the nearby city of Brindisi that they were investigating allegations a “young foreign woman” was forced to have “non-consensual” sexual relations over two days."
"A former deputy lead of the Data Management Unit set up by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to combat the COVID-19 pandemic leaked the daily number of COVID-19 cases to a chat group of 50 people, even offering a small prize to those who managed to predict the figures.  Zhao Zheng, a 37-year-old Singapore citizen, was sentenced to 18 weeks' jail on Tuesday (Feb 22). She pleaded guilty to 12 charges, mostly for wrongful communication of information under the Official Secrets Act. Another 12 charges were taken into consideration.  The court heard that Zhao was working as an assistant director of the Biostatistics and Research Branch of the Public Health Division of MOH before the pandemic broke out."
"He said Japan takes seriously the importance of maintaining equal and fair access to safe, effective and high-quality vaccines for all countries and regions, and that the Japanese government has been providing support through cooperation with COVAX, an international cooperative program formed to make sure low- and middle-income countries have fair access to COVID-19 vaccines, as well as with WHO and related governments.  Since June 2021, Japan has provided 42 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine - 17.6 million doses through COVAX and 24.6 doses via bilateral deals.  Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt said Friday he had been unaware of the allegations against Kasai before reading media reports and would seek a briefing from the WHO.  He suggested the WHO’s internal processes for examining such significant allegations would benefit from some kind of external oversight.  “We will be asking the WHO for independent advice as to the nature and response to these claims,” Hunt said."
"Hong Kong-born actor and singer Nicholas Tse revealed on Sunday (Sep 5) that he is in the process of giving up his Canadian citizenship. He made the announcement on the China Central Television (CCTV) programme, Perception Room.  The 41-year-old Tse, whose current film Raging Fire is enjoying great success at the moment, said during the programme that he had come across online comments about the movie where some people were questioning his nationality and saying that he’s Canadian.  “I wondered, why would they say that,” Tse said, adding that the comments made his “heart skip a beat”.  He said that he has always been a Chinese national because he was born in Hong Kong and that he has always wanted to spread Chinese culture and spirit to the world, be it through food, music or action movies."
"Standard Chartered Bank robber David James Roach has had his caning sentence set aside to fulfil the assurance given by Singapore to the UK in his extradition proceedings.  No alternative punishment will be imposed on Roach in lieu of caning, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Sunday (Jul 25).  The Canadian national, now 31, fled Singapore for Thailand after robbing a Standard Chartered branch in Holland Village of S$30,450 on Jul 7, 2016.  He was detained in Thailand and deported to Canada in 2018, but was held by British police while in transit after Singapore put in an arrest request."
"With the durian season hitting a peak over the last couple of weeks, Louis Lee feels grateful for the bounty of fruits he gets to sell.  The 31-year-old Malaysian, who owns and operates a durian stall at Owen Road, has seen a spike in business and profits amid a bumper crop of the thorny fruit coming in from Johor and Pahang.  Contented with the additional income, he decided to help groups of people whose lives have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In an interview with CNA at his shop on Tuesday (Jun 29), Lee said he was counting his lucky stars because in spite of the pandemic, he still earned a good living."""
"An American MMA instructor was jailed four years on Thursday (Mar 2) for having sex with two 15-year-old girls and filming the acts for his own “perverse pleasure”.  When Joshua Robinson’s apartment was raided, officers seized 5,902 obscene films, including 321 films of child pornography. The haul is believed to be the largest collection of child pornography seized from an individual in Singapore.  Robinson, 39, pleaded guilty to nine charges: Three of having sex with minors under 16, five for making and possessing obscene films and one for showing an obscene film to a six-year-old girl. Another 20 charge were taken into consideration during sentencing.  Robinson was caught in June 2015, two days after his second victim “had a mental breakdown and cried” and went to the police."
"Ms Ramayana, who attends the University of Jambi in Sumatra, is among some 1,900 Indonesian university students who were duped into paying huge fees for bogus internships that claimed to be part of an official German working holiday programme known as ferienjob.  The Indonesian police are investigating human trafficking allegations related to the scheme, after four Indonesians raised the alarm in May 2023. While on the “internship”, they ran out of money after being owed their wages and contacted the Indonesian Embassy in Berlin for help.

One of them is a 27-year-old Malaysian who works as a car groomer at BlackNano, located at 1 Bukit Batok Crescent. The man, a work permit holder, does not typically interact with customers, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (May 8).  His serology test result is negative.   The other case is a 54-year-old permanent resident who is a car mechanic at Jag Technical Services, located at 209 New Upper Changi Road. "
"The first case reported on Monday is a 44-year-old Singaporean who works as an operations officer at Raffles Medical, located at Changi Airport Terminal 3.   The man, known as Case 63047, developed a blocked nose on May 9 but did not seek medical treatment, said the Health Ministry.   He was swabbed on the same day as part of MOH’s special COVID-19 testing operations for all workers in Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3, as well as Jewel Changi Airport.   His test result came back positive on May 10 and he was taken in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serology test result is pending."
"SINGAPORE: A man who allegedly slapped a 69-year-old SMRT employee was charged on Wednesday (Aug 29) with one count of voluntarily causing hurt.  Shafuan Juraimi, 21, is accused of slapping Mr Gian Cheng Kuan once on his face with his right hand at about 7.30pm on Jun 25 this year.  He was at the train platform at Raffles Place MRT station eating when he was spotted by Mr Gian, an SMRT service ambassador who was performing crowd control duties.

"The Learning Lab has eight outlets across Singapore, according to its website.  In addition to United Square, the other outlets are located at Marine Parade Central, Tampines Mall, Century Square, Seletar Mall, Rochester Mall, Jem and Choa Chu Kang Centre.  Classrooms at all its centres will be deep cleaned and sanitised this weekend by professional cleaners approved by the National Environment Agency, said The Learning Lab.  The Learning Lab said it remains in contact with MOH and is cooperating with the authorities to assist with contact tracing.  The Learning Lab said it has implemented “strict safety measures” since the outbreak of the pandemic, including thorough cleaning and sanitation of classrooms and facilities, ensuring that all staff members and students keep their masks on, as well as staggered class dismissal timings to prevent intermingling between groups."
"SINGAPORE: A man who stole 11 live crabs worth more than S$800 from a seafood restaurant in Punggol was jailed for a week on Thursday (Jul 22).  Abdul Karim Mohamad, 60, was also fined S$1,000 for failing to wear a mask properly while dishonestly taking two bags of groceries left briefly at a lift lobby in Sengkang.  The court heard that Abdul Karim was unemployed at the time of the theft in September 2020.

"It’s no secret that Singaporeans love holidaying in Japan, especially during this time of the year when the weather is nice and cold. For those who have decided to avoid the December peak travel season, there’s still a little slice of Kyoto to check out at Orchard Road, via a new traditional teahouse called Ingen Kyoto at ION Orchard.  The intimate 28-seat space opened on Friday (Dec 22). It offers counter seats, a table for larger groups as well as a tatami room.  IT’S OPENED BY HVALA'S OWNERS  Ingen Kyoto is owned by the same folks behind Japanese-style cafe chain Hvala, which also sells Japan-imported matcha powder. The sparse, Zen teahouse is aptly named after Zen Buddhist monk Ingen Ryuki."
"If you’ve ever studied or worked at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), you’ll do a double take when you walk past Osa Kaki Fuyong at Beauty World’s food centre. The Japanese fusion stall, which opened in early September, serves a slightly elevated version of the polytechnic’s best-loved dish.  Chances are you’d have queued up for the super popular (and original) “Kaki Fuyong” dish at the polytechnic’s canteen.  Sold at the Japanese Cuisine stall at NP’s Makan Place food court (which is open to the public), generations of students have eaten it and curious first-timers have joined the queue because #FOMO. Yes, even this writer, who is an NP lecturer, has succumbed. This dish is so popular, that it even inspired a student web series named after it."
"The team conducting the study is from NTU and TUMCREATE, the Technical University of Munich’s multidisciplinary research platform in Singapore, alongside infrastructure consultancy Surbana Jurong. CLEAN ENERGY SOURCE  Researchers said the “promising findings” are a significant breakthrough as they could provide a valuable non-fossil fuel option for energy in resource-scarce Singapore.  Solar power is the most viable renewable energy source for the nation, but geothermal could fill some gaps that solar poses, they said.  “Geothermal energy has quite a lot of advantages over photovoltaic (PV). For instance, it provides continuous and constant energy. It is not subject to fluctuations,” said principal scientist Tobias Massier from TUMCREATE."
"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Turf Club will hold its last race in October next year, marking the end of horse racing in Singapore.  The land the Turf Club occupies in Kranji will be handed back to the government by 2027 for redevelopment.  Here's a look back at more than 180 years of horse racing in Singapore:  Oct 4, 1842: The Singapore Turf Club was founded as the Singapore Sporting Club by Scottish merchant William Henry Macleod Read and a group of horse racing enthusiasts. It was then located at Farrer Park.   It was renamed the Singapore Turf Club in 1924.  Feb 23 & 25, 1843: The club’s first race was held to mark the 24th anniversary of Singapore’s founding by Sir Stamford Raffles. The race day was declared a holiday."

"Swiss watchmaker Richard Mille has a new home in Singapore. On Friday (Oct 6), the brand, known for its large tonneau shaped watches, opened the doors to its new flagship boutique in the country, located at 1 St Martin's Drive in the district of Orchard Road.  The 700 sq m boutique – which took three years to complete – eschews the design of a typical watch store. Instead, it adopts the fundamentals of a speakeasy, its facade concealing a surprising venue deeper within.   “The architectural organisation of St Martin creates a feeling of astonishment of not having guessed such a space could exist behind this door. Discovering it makes you wonder what the next surprise will be. Our intention was to play with visitors’ expectations, shared Richard Mille’s brand director Alexandre Mille, the son of its eponymous founder. """
"The court heard that Mdm Isip had a Bachelor of Science in Architecture and had worked in the construction industry for 27 years, including 16 in Singapore.  On the day of the incident on Apr 8 last year, she was at the CapitaSpring building in the central business district, working for contractor Dragages Singapore.  Dragages had engaged a contractor to set up a gondola system to clean the interior facade wall of the building.  As part of the setup, workers on the 16M floor removed the grating cover of the catwalk to review a false ceiling access panel underneath.  It was discovered that the false ceiling around the gondola track was obstructing the installation, so part of the false ceiling panels had to be cut before further work could be done."
"This month, the four pals have decided to upgrade their operations to a dine-in Thai cafe called Fourgather at Amoy Hotel in Telok Ayer. The 80-seat night market-style eatery is accessible via the Fuk Tak Chi Museum, one of the oldest Taoist temples in Singapore.  The cafe is split into a main dining hall and lounge, decorated with items sourced from Thailand. A team of Thai chefs helms the kitchen here. There is also a bar within the space, which serves Thai street food bar snacks and tipples like cocktails, spirits and beer.  Ade, 37, is managed by Mediacorp’s The Celebrity Agency. Other than running her own restaurant, her day job is photographing stars like Fann Wong, Christopher Lee, Richie Koh and Cynthia Koh."
"Air, located at Dempsey Hill, occupies a 40,000 sq ft space that includes a barracks complex that was once a clubhouse for civil servants; a beckoning lawn and a “garden farm” where edible plants are cultivated for use in the restaurant.  But where in Dempsey, you ask, is this hidden glade of wonders? Well, it’s behind the large carpark off Holland Road, an area you’ll have missed because you’re too busy making your way to Samy’s Curry or Long Beach.  Back in March last year, “Will sent me a message: ‘Can you be in Singapore in 48 hours?’” Orlando recounted. Akili had managed to secure the site. “I flew in, stood on that lawn, when there was tall grass everywhere… I was 100 per cent with my initial gut feeling.”"
"There are actually three sub brands under the Ilmiri company in Korea, which is why the Singapore outlet takes on the name Ilmiri Korean Fusion Cuisine. According to the managing director of Ilmiri Singapore, Jessie Choi, they wanted to give Singapore customers more options, and decided to combine the best-selling menus from each Ilmiri brand"".  The Singapore branch is an 85-seater located in Boat Quay, and is Singapore’s first Korean restaurant specialising in Andong jjimdak (Korean braised chicken), which apparently originated from the city of Andong. It’s a spicy dish featuring chicken braised in a sweet and savoury soya-based sauce, spiked with both dried and fresh whole chilli peppers. It’s usually served with glass noodles."""
"I overheard an elderly gentleman telling the staff that he had forgotten to bring his wallet. “Never mind, hutang (Malay for debt)!” came the cheerful reply. He was obviously a regular customer and their easy exchange added to the authentic, old-school kopitiam experience.  When Agus proclaimed “I love the place! Nothing to explain, just eat!”, I understood. We didn’t need more words. Just the knowledge that lontong and sotong were the perfect breakfast combo to chase the storm clouds away.  Java Corner is located in Khong Guan Restaurant, 49 Stirling Road, Singapore 141049. It’s open Mondays to Fridays, 7.30am to 4pm, closed on weekends and public holidays.

"There is a new bak chor mee (minced meat noodles) stall to try, and it’s opened by the family behind the famous Ah Orh Seafood Restaurant at Jalan Bukit Merah.   The stall, which is called Orh Huat Bak Chor Mee, is located at Chinatown Complex, according to a post by hawker Melvin Chew on his Facebook group Hawkers United.   It is helmed by the younger brother of Wu Ling Zhen, 75, the owner of Ah Orh Seafood Restaurant.  Wu Ling Zhen’s youngest son runs an Ah Orh Teochew Fish Head Steamboat hawker stall at Bedok.   The stall’s menu is pretty straightforward, just three types of noodles: Minced meat, pig’s liver and fishball at S$5 a bowl and S$6 for an upsized portion. Strangely, the stall also adds beansprouts to its bak chor mee, but you can request to omit it from your order."
"The Garden Pod at Gardens by the Bay was officially opened on Thursday (Sep 1). The hotel, offering two-storey suites, is set against a panoramic view of the city skyline of downtown Marina Bay, amidst the unique foliage of Serene Garden.  Supported by Singapore Tourism Board and designed by President’s Design Award winner LAUD Architects, The Garden Pod provides a unique offering for visitors who want to escape the hustle and bustle of urban living.

"Prior to the reopening of Auriga Spa, located at Capella Singapore, the spa already had a long waiting list of customers. “Once the reopening was announced, we saw a huge surge in bookings for the upcoming month,” shared Cassandra Forrest, Director of Spa & Wellness at Capella Singapore.   “Demand during opening weekend was strong and we’ve continued to do our best to accommodate guests’ requests and ensure that the experience is enjoyable.”  Although booking numbers are not the same as pre-circuit breaker levels as the spa is still missing tourists and business from the hotel itself, Forrest said that the spa is 80 per cent back to normal. “We have very limited spaces available during the weekends,” she said."
"Apple has announced plans to pump in over US$250 million (S$340 million) to expand its Ang Mo Kio campus in Singapore.  Two buildings acquired in 2022, which are next to its existing offices, will undergo a major upgrade. This will bring ""three unique spaces together to foster greater collaboration for Apple’s growing teams"", the tech giant said in a statement on Wednesday (Apr 17).  Construction is slated to start this year.  Singapore serves as a central operations centre for Apple in the region and is a hub for critical roles in software, hardware, services and support.   ""The new expansion is the latest milestone in Apple's over four decades of work fostering job creation and deep connections with the local community, and will provide space for growth and new roles in artificial intelligence and other key functions,"" said Apple.

"After launching the event, Dr Tan took part in a discussion on the topic of “How employers can empower workers to strengthen their career health”.  Also on the panel was OCBC Bank group chief executive officer Helen Wong and Dr Bicky Bhangu, co-lead of Action for Alliance, Widening Access to Talent, which is one of several industry-led coalitions working in partnership with the government.  Both employers and employees need to play their part in keeping abreast with disruption in the industry to stay relevant, said the panellists.  On the one hand, employees have the responsibility to “proactively engage and innovate”, said Dr Bhangu, who is also a council member of the Singapore National Employers Federation."
"Some blame the oversupply of university graduates for the challenging labour market situation. In 2022, the number of new graduates entering the job market crossed the 10-million mark for the first time.  Some observers said there is still room for more highly educated workers, but jobs need to be created and firms must be ready to hire them.  “I still wouldn't reach the conclusion that China is way over-educated by this point, because we still need more university graduates,” said Hang Seng Bank (China) chief economist Dan Wang.  “But how can you create an environment where companies feel comfortable to take in those fresh graduates and train them in order to prepare them for future jobs? That’s a problem.”"
"“As it is becoming more common to have two or more different careers across adult working age, what may be non-career related in the present could be a very viable proposition in the future,"" said Assoc Prof Yu.    Whether the knowledge gained from a course is ""useful"" ultimately depends on the individual, said Assistant Professor Aaron Ng from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).  The lecturer in digital communications and integrated media added that individuals should think more deeply about the trajectories of their careers and lives to make effective use of the SkillsFuture credits.   “The government can help by lowering the barriers to gaining knowledge, but I don't think the government should be micromanaging the individual's future.” "
"Still, while markets have become buoyant, things look distinctly less rosy for many Japanese. Pay rises are failing to keep up with inflation, hurting their pocketbooks and undermining support for struggling Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. A Cabinet Office poll published on March 8 found 50.7 per cent of respondents were dissatisfied with their lives, while a survey by the Mainichi newspaper the same month found 87 per cent of respondents did not feel the economy was improving.  Mr Takashi Shiozawa, an executive at MFS, which operates an online mortgage broker, said: “For the BOJ, it might seem like just a 0.1 percentage point move to remove negative interest rates, but in terms of the average consumer, there’s a possibility that the negative psychological impact will be many times greater than that.”"
"As India’s wealth industry grows, that gap will narrow.  “Salaries will continue to rise given the large demand-supply gap at senior levels, as will talent for compliance, risk assessment and technology” in India, said Mr Amit Agarwal, managing partner at search firm Stanton Chase.  Banks are paying more for heads of businesses, and salaries of over US$1 million (S$1.34 million) are common for senior leaders, he said.  While India has higher income tax rates and weaker infrastructure than Singapore and Hong Kong, the lower cost of living is a benefit, according to the report.  The average monthly rent in upscale Bandra, Mumbai, is US$1.76 per sq ft, compared with US$5.29 in Hong Kong and US$5.09 in Singapore, according to government statistics, the report found. "
"The nationwide demand for qualified nurses and a shortage of care staff is a “perennial challenge”, said Ms Kok Ee Lan, head of human resources at NTUC Health.  The organisation has more than 1,500 staff members who serve over 10,000 people through its eldercare services, making it one of Singapore’s largest eldercare providers.  Citing ""tight manpower resources"" in the sector, Ms Kok said NTUC Health has stepped up efforts to recruit and retain staff.  These include supplementing its workforce with part-time employees and engaging institutes of higher learning for internships where students get exposure.  Mr Andy Lee, divisional director of seniors’ community services at Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities, said that “increased expectations” placed on healthcare workers add to their stress levels."
"“Big firms cannot ignore NTUC"" especially if they are laying off a substantial number of workers, he added. As the sole national trade union centre in Singapore, NTUC works closely with the Manpower Ministry and other government agencies.  Lazada's retrenchment exercise was deemed unacceptable by the union as it could have ""adverse societal effects"", said Dr Xu Le, a lecturer at the department of strategy and policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.  ""It may have a ripple effect, with other companies following this behaviour and resulting in more unemployment and social challenges,” Dr Xu said.   Even non-unionised companies should engage tripartite organisations and seek guidance before retrenchments, said Mr Aslam Sardar, CEO of the Institute for Human Resource Professionals. "
"The jobless rate for those aged 16 to 24 has remained at an elevated level, hitting 21.3 per cent in June before Beijing suspended publication of the data.  “The employment difficulty for domestic graduates in China will inevitably spread to overseas students,” said Peng Peng, executive chairman of the Guangdong Society of Reform think tank.  Li did not consider returning to China to work until the final year of her three-year programme, when a family illness prompted her to look for opportunities closer to home.  However, even students who enrol in one-year programmes overseas are quick to conclude prospects are better in China, choosing to make the journey back when their studies are over."
"Toucan Telemarketing, a UK employee-owned company, has decided this year to halt Christmas festivities in favour of vouchers. “We’ve been going for 22 years, and normally have (a sit-down dinner at a local pub) every year,” Paula Bates, managing director, says. “COVID-19 put a stop to it, and it hasn’t happened since.”  This year the company put options to the vote: Instead of a party, staff chose vouchers to help pay for their Christmas lunch at home. “One guy says he gets his turkey and party food,” Bates says. This is in addition to a bonus. “It’s nice to know they’ll have that voucher that might go towards a Christmas that might be a bit harder (due to the cost of living crisis).”"
"Until three months ago, University of Pennsylvania psychology professor Michael Kahana said he had never felt the need to wear a yarmulke, or Jewish skullcap, to his classes.  ""It started Oct. 7. I now feel that if I don't wear a yarmulke then my students might not feel that they can,"" said Kahana, one of the organisers of some 30 Penn faculty on a solidarity mission to Israel this week.  The aim was mainly to build bridges with the Israeli academic community. Faculty met with Penn alumni, political and hospital leaders and hostage families and toured sites in Israel where Palestinian Hamas fighters attacked on Oct. 7."
"Professor Asit K. Biswas, a water policy expert now with the National University of Singapore and Julian Kirchherr, an Oxford University researcher, wrote a piece titled Professors, No One is Listening to You.  Some professors disdain the popular media and write only academic articles in journals. Trouble is, no one reads those. Well, almost no one.  Here's what they say: ""Up to 1.5 million peer-reviewed articles are published annually. However, many are ignored even within scientific communities - 82 percent of articles published in humanities are not even cited once.  ""No one ever refers to 32 percent of the peer-reviewed articles in the social and 27 percent in the natural sciences."
"After nearly 15 years in the Republic of Singapore Air Force, Mr Ivan Lua's desire for a corporate job led him to consider working in emerging growth sectors.  The 36-year-old eventually made a mid-career switch to cybersecurity at a bank, after taking up the technology in finance immersion programme offered by Workforce Singapore and the Institute of Banking and Finance in 2021.   “I see (cybersecurity) as an area with a very wide range of opportunities to train in and subsequently explore in my career path,” said the information and cybersecurity risk specialist at Standard Chartered Bank.

"It was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.  Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI's technology across its suite of productivity software, a move that helped spark a rebound in its cloud-computing business in the July-September quarter.  Apple, meanwhile, has been grappling with weakening demand, including for the iPhone, its biggest cash cow. Demand in China, a major market, has slumped as the country's economy makes a slow recovery from the pandemic and a resurgent Huawei chips away at its market share."
"HIF intends to supply Eneos with carbon-neutral e-fuels produced in the United States, Chile and Australia, the companies said in a statement. They have not yet signed a contract.  HIF Executive Director Meg Gentle told Reuters the focus of talks was for HIF-made e-gasoline, which Eneos can distribute in Japan.  Also under consideration is using HIF-produced e-methanol in Japan as marine fuel, with Eneos further processing the e-fuel at its refinery in Japan to make e‐gasoline and carbon neutral aviation fuel, Gentle said.  Markets around the world are shifting to electric vehicles, with some such as China making a rapid shift as governments mandate sales of EVs to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions."
"The court was told on Monday and Tuesday that Kunsevitsky grew up in Russia before migrating to Australia with his family when he was 12. He moved to Singapore in the 2000s.  He was employed by Singapore beauty firm Esthemedica, where he was a director. The company told CNA on Wednesday it had not known about his crimes and they were speaking to him as recently as last Friday about business plans.  Of his 44 victims, 36 were aged between 10 years old and 15 years old at the time of the offences, and eight were aged between 16 years old and 17 years old."
"The court heard that Gunaselan was a bus driver employed by Singapore-Johor Express, a company providing transport between Singapore and Malaysia.  On the morning of Jun 24, 2019, he drove a bus with several passengers on board, including the victim, 74-year-old Tuminah Sapie.  At about 10.45am, he stopped at the departure concourse of Woodlands Checkpoint for passengers to alight.  Shortly after Gunaselan drove off, Madam Tuminah was found lying bloodied on the ground, after the rear tyre of the bus ran over both her legs.  At trial, Gunaselan argued that he had not acted negligently and could not have endangered Mdm Tuminah's safety."
"A reporter for an independent Russian news outlet was sentenced to seven years in prison on Wednesday (Mar 6) for articles he wrote about alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, his publication said.  Roman Ivanov, who works for the online RusNews, was convicted of publishing ""fake news"" about the Russian army under wartime censorship laws passed shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago.  Russia has used those laws to crack down on journalists and activists who report information that counters Kremlin narratives of what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine.  The charges against Ivanov stem from articles he wrote about a massacre in Bucha, Ukraine, a UN war crimes report and Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure."
"A Lee Kong Chian Research Fellow at the Singapore Management University, Assoc Prof Chow had previously served as a lead author for the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

"A National University of Singapore (NUS) professor who drove his Maserati against traffic was on Monday (Nov 26) given the maximum fine of S$5,000 and banned from driving.  Henry Yeung Wai Chung, whose brief biography on the NUS website says he is a professor in the Department of Geography, pleaded guilty to one charge of dangerous driving.  District Judge Lorraine Ho banned Yeung, 50, from driving for 13 months.  The court heard that Yeung was travelling on the right lane of a two-lane road along Lorong Chuan towards Braddell Road, at about 1.15pm on Sep 7 this year.  A white car in front of him began changing lane to the left, but instead of waiting for the vehicle to finish doing so, Yeung overtook it on the right."
"Mr Gurusamy was employed by Full House Building Construction at the time of the accident on Aug 29, 2019.  When the lorry driver braked abruptly, he was flung upwards in the back of the lorry and struck by the canopy system.  According to the judge, this accident struck Mr Gurusamy ""at the prime of his life and left him with significant injuries to his right elbow and left shoulder"" which required surgery.  After the accident, he was medically assessed and found to be unfit for work.  His employer terminated him and sent him back to India on Jan 16, 2021."
"Piyush Gupta, CEO of Singapore's biggest bank DBS Group and one of the highest-paid CEOs in the country, saw his total compensation drop 27.3 per cent for 2023, according to the lender's annual report published on Wednesday (Mar 6).  Gupta's total compensation fell to S$11.2 million (US$8.34 million) in 2023 from S$15.4 million in 2022, the annual report showed.  The lower total compensation followed a 30 per cent cut in his variable pay to take accountability for last year's digital banking disruptions at DBS, even as Southeast Asia's largest lender posted a record 2023 profit with a return of equity of 18 per cent."
"TikTok's Singaporean CEO Chew Shou Zi was on Wednesday (Jan 31) asked repeatedly about his ties with China, in his first appearance before US lawmakers since March last year.  Chew was among the leaders of the biggest social media companies grilled by US senators – the latest effort by lawmakers to address the concerns of parents and mental health experts that social media companies put profits over guardrails that would ensure their platforms do not harm children.  Chew testified along with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, X CEO Linda Yaccarino, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Discord CEO Jason Citron.  ""I'M SINGAPOREAN"" US Senator Tom Cotton on Wednesday repeatedly asked Chew about his ties with China."

Asked for more details, Mr Huang said he could only reveal more after going over the proposals with Singapore officials. CNA has contacted EDB for comment."
"As a sovereign wealth fund, GIC’s purpose is to manage part of Singapore’s reserves. But beyond its primary goal, the fund also considers the impact of its investments, including on people and the environment.  “In allocating capital to these different communities around the world, it also has a positive impact in terms of supporting businesses, building infrastructure, creating jobs even,” said CEO Lim Chow Kiat.  He was speaking to CNA ahead of receiving the Dwight D Eisenhower Global Citizenship Award in New York this week.  “We are thoughtful in how we deploy capital. We take a long-term view. We factor many things in even as we, of course, are in pursuit of good returns,” he said."

"He started receiving education in Singapore at St Joseph's Institution here. He later completed his studies at the University of Malaya through a government bursary, which obligated him to teach for five years post-graduation.   His journey in education started as a teacher at RI in 1959.   Before returning to RI to helm the school almost three decades later, Wijeysingha served as principal at Changkat Changi Secondary School in 1967, and Temasek Junior College (TJC) in 1980.  In between the tenures, he also held several positions in the Ministry of Education, such as assistant director of education and deputy director for school organisation."
"Nai was mesmerised about fabric manipulation when he studied fashion design at Temasek Polytechnic, a module he admitted was the most memorable for him. Even as a student, he recalls being very opinionated about the concepts and techniques he wanted to pursue, a quality he continues to uphold till this day.  Due to the natural fermentation and extraction process, each batch of dye is different, giving rise to unique results.  Vani Rajandran, deputy director of the School of Design at Temasek Polytechnic, was his former teacher and remains a good friend and life-coach to Nai today. She said: “Felix has a very clear sense of purpose and direction as one of the very few artisans in the field of indigo dyeing. Not many people are exploring this niche area in Singapore, and he was willing to do something uncharted."
"Netizens have come up with T-shirt designs emblazoned with the quote, which has inspired a song with the same title.  Others on social media also got in on the fun.  Local blogger and former ACS boy Lee Kin Mun, better known as mrbrown, took a dig at the saga in a video posted on social media.  Singaporean author Gwee Li Sui also wrote on Facebook: “How many ACS boys does it take to change a light bulb? None. We are not electricians. We are ACS boys.”  Among ACS’ notable alumni are President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan, Olympic swimming champion Joseph Schooling and Mandopop star JJ Lin."
"I don’t really tell my dad so much about my secondary school life because he doesn’t really understand what happens in our school,” said Shan Ni, a student at Riverside Secondary School.  Another parent of a teenage student is Janice Soh, who believes she has a “pretty close” relationship with her son, Apelles Yeo. “I know quite a bit of Apelles’ school life,” she said — at least, she thought so.  Her son, a student at Bowen Secondary School, said: “I don’t go into details, so it’s mostly surface-level stuff. … My mum only knows about 40 per cent of my school life.”
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-outram-secondary-school-students-alumni-sadness-nostalgia-school-relocation-sengkang-4064696	Mr Tan noted that the experiences students have are integral to their common identity, adding that the school will be setting up a heritage space at its new location.   Outram Secondary School will not have a swimming pool on its premises when it moves to its new location in Sengkang. Some former students and parents expressed sadness about the move.   “It is a shame because after shifting, I think it will change the environment a little bit,” said former student Luke Goh, who graduated in 2018.   “It has over 100 years of history. So I think the attitude towards sports and extra-curriculars could change, but we'll have to see.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/polytechnics-no-more-inferior-option-big-read-4097026	Likewise, National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate Abdul Qayyum described the three years he spent studying for a diploma in law and management at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) as very enriching as he became “more mature and developed a lot holistically”.  Mr Abdul too had the option to go to a junior college but opted to pursue a diploma. Several teachers in his secondary school had supported his choice, he recalled.  “Some teachers felt that many of us were better suited in polytechnics and did not have the necessary ‘rigour’ for the junior college curriculum and A-Level examinations,” said Mr Abdul.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/memory-loss-jc-student-jurong-pioneer-junior-college-4141186	Junior college (JC) student Fiona Yek finds organic chemistry fun because she loves understanding how things are formed.   The 20-year-old would know, for instance, how diamonds are formed under pressure. And that’s not just because she aspires to become a chemistry teacher.   Ms Yek from Jurong Pioneer JC was a high achiever who scored As and Bs consistently. Getting good grades was her “whole thing” – until it wasn't.  One day in her first JC year, she was struck by sudden memory loss on the way to school. The episode repeated itself over the next two years, affecting her once-stellar track record and emotional well-being.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/levels-student-sister-died-new-zealand-crash-family-matters-studies-4144511	On Monday, Apr 17, 2023, Jurong Pioneer Junior College student Shannon Chong was in class at 2.58pm, two minutes before the end of a mathematics tutorial, when she received a call from her mother.   It was unusual for her mother, a housewife, to call during school hours. Since Shannon, then a J2 student, was still in class, she called her back when the tutorial ended minutes later.   It ended up being the kind of call no one would ever want to receive.   Shannon’s older sister had been killed in a road accident in New Zealand. Her mother relayed the news over the phone in disbelief, suspecting that it could be a scam.
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn3d5k4yr0ro	The 100 Faces campaign also features England footballer Beth Mead, actor Amit Shah, and Nobel Prize winning economist Sir Chris Pissarides.  Being the first person in my family to go to university was scary as I didn’t know what to expect,"" said Ms Bowers, 22, who graduated last summer with a degree in Professional Policing.  ""But my family, partner and friends are all so proud of me.""  Mr Shah also studied at Staffordshire University more than 20 years ago and has since acted in television shows such as Doctor Who and Mr Bates vs the Post Office. In 2023, he received an extra honorary degree from the university."
"When we first started, it was the time when there were a lot of shipment and vessel issues. We also had to wait a long time and we had an empty warehouse for two months. At the start it was very rocky, and a lot of people were saying how it was not a very good time to start a business during COVID.   “But I think we’ve just been very lucky that there are a lot of people who are starting to be passionate about sustainability, and that’s why we’re still alive.”   The team still has about half of the 8,000kg of clothes to sift through. Ms Cheow, who graduated with a degree in arts and social sciences majoring in psychology from the National University of Singapore last July, said the business has almost reached its break-even point. "
"The National University of Singapore (NUS) Commencement Ceremony is ""not a forum for advocacy"", said the university on Thursday (Jul 14), after a student held up an anti-death penalty sign during his graduation ceremony last week.  NUS student Luke Levy alleged on Twitter on Monday that the university had ""tried their hardest to erase"" what he did on stage, and had edited out his time on stage in a recording of the ceremony.  Responding to CNA queries, the university said: “The NUS commencement is an important ceremony celebrating the achievements of our 13,975 graduates and the completion of their NUS journey.   “All graduates and guests are expected to conduct themselves appropriately during the occasion. It is not a forum for advocacy.” "
"When Jonathan Tiong was an infant, a neurologist told his parents that he wouldn’t live past the age of two.  He was diagnosed with type two spinal muscular atrophy, a rare genetic condition that causes muscles to become weak and break down. It is also a progressive disease, meaning he has become, and will likely get, weaker with time.  But in October, the same day he turned 24 years old, he was crowned valedictorian for the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Class of 2021, with the equivalent of a first class honours."
"Upset that his university was investigating him for allegedly harassing female students, Mohd Johan Arif Irwan Tan sent threatening emails to several staff members, saying he would go to the campus with a knife and cut their throats.  The 35-year-old Malaysian was sentenced to three weeks’ jail on Friday (Jan 19) for his actions last year.  He pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal intimidation and chose to begin serving his jail sentence immediately.  The court heard that Johan was pursuing a master’s degree in media and communication at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)’s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information, which investigated a complaint against him for the alleged harassment of some female NTU students."
"A psychology undergraduate at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) was sentenced on Wednesday (Sep 23) to nine months and three weeks' jail for taking 469 illicit videos of 335 women.  Shaun Ho Yan Liang, 26, pleaded guilty last week to two charges of insulting a woman's modesty and one charge of possessing obscene films. A fourth charge was taken into consideration.  He admitted taking the clips between February 2018 and July 2018 at locations including Eastpoint Mall, an overhead bridge at the North Spine of NTU, the student activity centre at NTU and a laboratory at the National Institute of Education.  He targeted women who wore shorts or skirts, and would either squat or stand close to them to film the videos. "
"Institutes of Higher Learning are also using design to tackle complex real-world problems.   At the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), some students have worked with the Changi General Hospital to construct a pavilion next to Block 70 Bedok South Road, with designs that encourage seniors to stay active.   The team considered various age-friendly features, including ergonomic structures, for the pavilion, said SUTD architecture student Ian Chung. “We also incorporated armrests and also a large table for them to have their own activities (as well as) some gardening areas.”  But beyond design, the university is hoping to add artificial intelligence into the mix."
"Chew, who studied architecture at Cambridge University, admits the industry is not an easy one. “The field of architecture demands a great deal of dedication and a significant amount of time to perfect.” But she thrives in its challenges and enjoys mentoring younger staff members. Chew has also taught architecture in Singapore Polytechnic  – a role she hopes will inspire the next generation of architects to go into practice.  Among her proudest works the International French School (Singapore) or Lycee Francais de Singapour, made with pre-fabricated components to save material that was done prior to joining WATG, and the Crowne Plaza Sanya Haitang Bay in Hainan, China, completed when she was at the firm. Her dream projects include a carbon-neutral hospitality project as well as facility for active senior communities to encourage purposeful living in the later years, reflecting her environment- and user-focused focus."
"Pallavi, who is a student at One World International School Singapore, edged out four other contestants at the Grand Finals held at Mediacorp on Sunday (Mar 31) evening.  The Grand Finals, hosted by actor-host Jaynesh Isuran, was divided into two rounds. In the first, the finalists sang renditions of beloved Tamil melodies while in the second, they navigated changes in tempo and pitch in their performances.  “Ultimately, Pallavi triumphed with her charisma, vocal finesse and distinct musical style. Throughout the competition, Pallavi showcased exceptional growth and dedication, delivering spellbinding performances across diverse musical genres, which culminated in the win,” said Mediacorp in a statement."
"Ms Hasyimah Ayuni has only recently taken an interest in Islam outside the mosque.  The youngest of seven siblings, Ms Hasyimah, who is pursuing a masters degree in environmental health at a university in Malaysia’s Klang Valley, now believes that it is her duty to live in accordance with Islamic principles.   This came about following a court case that challenged the validity of several Syariah laws in the eastern state of Kelantan in February.      Ms Hasyimah told CNA that as Malaysia has a Muslim majority, it was logical that laws for Muslims be given priority over other laws.  She also wants Malaysia to use Syariah laws instead of the common law system being used today.  "
"It was supposed to be an exciting day for Ms Jenny Hia. After six months of studying remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the teenager finally set foot at Public Vocational School Number 2 in Indonesia’s Padang City in January 2021.   She was hoping she could meet new friends, but all she got were awkward stares from schoolmates and teachers.  The Christian teenager, then 16, was the only girl in school who did not wear the hijab, a Muslim headscarf meant to conceal a woman’s hair and neck and a mandatory garment for all female students at the school.  Over the next few days, Ms Hia was summoned by various school officials about her refusal to wear the item. One teacher even brought four Christian students, all of whom had decided to comply with the public school’s regulation, to put pressure on her to do the same."
"An Oxford graduate's failure to get a top degree cost him a lucrative legal career, the High Court has heard.  Faiz Siddiqui alleges ""inadequate"" teaching on his modern history course resulted in him getting an upper second degree in June 2000.  He blames staff being absent on sabbatical leave and is suing the university for £1m.  Oxford denies negligence and causation and says the case is ""massively"" outside the legal time limit.  Mr Siddiqui also alleges medical information about him was not submitted to examiners by a tutor.  The 39-year-old studied at Brasenose College and singled out the teaching on the Indian special subject part of his course for criticism."
"This came after the Federal Court ruled on Feb 12 that Kelantan, governed by PAS, cannot expand the jurisdiction of its Syariah law to include criminal acts already covered by federal powers.  Dr Muhammad Khalil is an Islamic scholar, having completed religious studies in Yemen and the United Kingdom before obtaining a PhD at the local University Sultan Zainal Abidin.  “(Dr Muhammad Khalil) is being groomed … he is put to the fore and may be seen as the person at the forefront for the party,” said political analyst Norshahril Saat, senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.  “But I’m not sure (where he stands) in the party ranks. Now because his father is there and is in charge, party members tend to give him a certain level of respect,” he added."
"It was a stint assisting in stewardship of gifts and donor programmes at her alma mater, the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), that led Ms Dian Amirah Binte Alias to her calling as a community partnerships executive at Boys’ Town.  Ms Dian, who holds a degree in Facilities and Events Management, was struck by the challenges faced by students who struggled to afford their school fees despite holding full-time jobs — and the positive impact that gifts and donor programmes made on their futures.  “These students not only became benefactors themselves, but also came back as educators. Some even joined the alumni committee, demonstrating a commitment to shaping and improving the university experience for future generations.” she reflected. “Witnessing this ‘chain reaction’ of generosity wasn’t just heartening — it displayed the significance of collective efforts in fostering a supportive community.”"
"K-pop fans will be familiar with the School of Performing Arts Seoul (SOPA). After all, the prestigious arts school is the alma mater of multiple South Korean idols such as BTS' Jungkook, EXO's Kai and Ive's Wonyoung.  Now, students from Southeast Asia can experience the learning curriculum of their favourite idols, thanks to SOPA's collaboration with Singapore Raffles Music College (SRMC). Called SOPA-SRMC, this school will be Singapore's first-ever K-pop high school programme.  During the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in Seoul, SOPA principal Hosung Lim said: ""As an educator, I am honoured that our educational accomplishments are being recognised globally through this MOU with Singapore Raffles Music College. We are determined to further elevate the School of Performing Arts Seoul's reputation as an exemplary educational institution not only in Korea but also overseas as an educational institution specialising in K-pop."""
"From radars to rainforests, AI is also finding use in the depths of some of Southeast Asia’s most ancient landscapes.  Students Clara Hernblom and Johan Närvä from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences are conducting research in the pristine - and also more degraded - forests of Sabah on Malaysia’s Borneo island.  They aim to better understand the levels of biodiversity and wildlife activity across different landscapes, including restoration sites. The findings could provide insights into the effectiveness of carbon credits, where companies can offset their carbon footprint through the restoration or preservation of forests.  To understand the ecosystem, they have placed dozens of audio recorders throughout the landscapes that they are studying. Over 10-day periods, the devices capture the sounds of the animals, birds and reptiles living there."
"In her late 40s and early 50s, Kaur was moved to take up a diploma in counselling psychology from a private institution as a means to develop her skills in listening to and supporting others.   Juggling her full-time job as an accountant, the mother of two would study for her diploma as well as fulfil attachments at the Institute of Mental Health as part of the curriculum. This allowed her to gain experience in counselling and interacting with people with mental health issues such as addiction.   In her mid-50s, she became drawn to volunteering with inmates and ex-offenders.   After going through the relevant courses at the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA), she started volunteering with both male and female inmates and ex-offenders as part of the Sikh Welfare Counsel (SIWEC)."
"Apparently, after finishing up Healing Heroes, Paige took her long-deserved break away from the limelight.  “I had been working non-stop since Singapore exited the circuit breaker so if you notice my socials, I went travelling every month,” she laughed.  The actress shared that she brought her parents to Hanoi, while she went with different groups of friends to Hong Kong, Hokkaido and Bintan.  Paige also said that she spent more time volunteering with Willing Hearts, a charity she has been involved in since 2008.  Having a relaxed schedule also allowed her to return to her alma mater, Mayflower Secondary School, and she got involved in a host of activities including a Teacher’s Day performance."
"The National University of Singapore (NUS) on Thursday (Mar 21) appointed Justice Judith Prakash, Mr Tan Chong Meng and Mr Ravi Menon to its board of trustees.   The three new members of the board, who are all NUS alumni, will begin their terms on Apr 1, the university said in a media release.  Justice Prakash, who is a senior judge, has served on the Supreme Court bench for more than 30 years.  She was the first woman to be appointed a permanent judge of the Court of Appeal and was previously the lead judge for arbitration matters.  She currently sits on the boards of trustees of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) and the Eurasian Association."
"“I am a homebody. So I have always dreamt of creating a space that I love,” the 34-year-old Singaporean mused. “Perhaps somewhere with a view of water or greenery, filled with light wood, light colours, warm lighting and a big sofa you can sink into. A place that evokes calm – where you can lie for hours and not have to think about anything in the world.”  Phan may enjoy fantasising about her dream home, but she never thought she would spend her career building dream home after dream home for others.  In fact, her career initially took a completely different career path. After studying statistics at the National University of Singapore, she chanced upon a job for an air traffic controller and ended up spending her early career working in the control tower directing pilots departing and arriving at Changi Airport."
"Growing up in Singapore with her expat family since her teens, Sander said she had a dysfunctional childhood. Despite a seemingly privileged environment, her home life was “unstable, with physical, emotional and verbal abuse from an alcoholic parent”.    At United World College where she studied, she found the only two things she could control were food and her grades. “I didn’t know at the time but I was weighing myself up to 20 times a day, restricting my meals.  “I even drew lines on my stomach with a marker of how I wanted my body to be. Simultaneously, I was studying all the time and anything less than an A would send me into bouts of distress.”"
"Tan lived in Singapore for two years in 2000 and 2001 when he studied at the Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). He did not require a student visa, paid the subsidised school fee rate for local students, and took up a Music Elective Programme scholarship that is open to Singapore citizens only.  “It is in my view inconceivable that, having studied in Singapore for two years in an all-boys school, he would not have been exposed to the fact that male Singapore citizens have to serve NS,” Justice Hoo added.  The prosecution also said that in any event, Tan had expressed his readiness in 2010 to serve NS if MINDEF could guarantee that he would not be prosecuted."
"So exactly how much input for the role came directly from Chieng, who famously lived in Singapore for 10 years, where he studied at both Fuchun and Yuhua Primary Schools, and later, Pioneer Secondary School and Pioneer Junior College?   “I didn’t even connect Jon Jon to being 'Ah Beng' until you mentioned it, but actually you’re right, he is an 'Ah Beng'! If you watch the film, he’s a total 'Ah Beng'! I can’t give away spoilers to what he does, but even his job is super 'Ah Beng'!” he admitted with a laugh.  “You know, I was speaking Chinese in the film. And at one point, I dropped some Bahasa Melayu in there as well. So yeah, he's very 'Ah Beng'!”"
"Singapore Sports School on Wednesday (Oct 11) said that it will investigate the death of a Secondary 2 student who felt unwell after a fitness trial.  The 14-year-old, identified by his uncle to CNA as Pranav Madhaik, felt unwell following a 400m fitness time trial on Oct 5.  The Singapore Civil Defence Force received a call for assistance at the Singapore Sports School at about 6.50pm on that day.  The boy was taken to the National University Hospital and he died on Wednesday.  “We will undertake a detailed investigation into the incident and thoroughly review our safety protocols, and will keep parents updated,"" the school said in response to CNA's queries."
"A foreign exchange student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) had barely arrived in the country when he went to a nightclub with his friends, got drunk and molested a waitress.  Pakistani student Butt Muhammad Abdullah, 22, was fined S$4,000 (US$2,900) on Monday (Sep 25) for one count of outraging the 30-year-old victim's modesty.  If he cannot pay the fine, he will have to serve four days in jail in default. Butt has already been in custody for four days as he was unable to raise bail.  The court heard that Butt holds a student pass and came to Singapore from Denmark, where he is a permanent resident, on a five-month student exchange programme with NUS."
"Foreign ministry spokespersons, compared to other diplomats, need to have better mastery of foreign language and better communication skills, especially with foreign journalists.  The two men are notably fluent in English, Mr Liu having studied at Oxford University in the 1980s and worked a four-year stint in the United Kingdom in the 1990s. They share the relaxed confidence lacking in many Chinese officials when facing public and foreign guests.  Both are engaging and witty. In 2008, after an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes in anger at then US President George W Bush, Mr Liu remarked in a media briefing: “Maybe I need to watch out, not just for who is raising their hands, but who is taking off their shoes.” Mr Qin joked about being labelled a wolf warrior when he became China’s ambassador to the US. “Now I'm back as the foreign minister, the media have stopped calling me that way. I feel kind of at a loss,” he said last year. "
"Through binoculars, he scans the rolling hills of fire-scorched savanna that lead out to a tree-crowned ridge in the distance. Here, on one of Brazil’s most hotly contested frontiers—where denuded scrubland pushes up against old-growth forest and private homesteads breach the boundaries of Indian land—the tire tracks bear a singular, ominous meaning.  “Loggers,” Tainaky says. The enemy.  Tainaky, who also goes by his Portuguese name, Laércio Souza Silva Guajajara, turns to his companions, four other Guajajara tribesmen, as they dismount road-beaten motorbikes. The patrol forms a motley crew: patched jeans and camouflage and aviator shades and bandannas to shield their faces from the ubiquitous dry-season dust. Bearing an equally modest array of weapons—a single-shot hunting rifle, a homemade pistol, a few machetes dangling from cinched waistbands—they call to mind a strange, cross-genre film. Think Mad Max meets The Last of the Mohicans."
"Blaise Sylliboy of Eskasoni First Nation and Kevin Hartling of Membertou First Nation were arrested by federal fisheries officers on the night of 26 March while fishing for elvers in a river in south-west Nova Scotia.  The season to harvest glass eels is relatively brief, beginning in March and typically running until May. Coveted in China and Japan, where they are grown on farms and harvested for food, the translucent fish command a steep price, with buyers paying $5,000 a kilogram last year.  Canada’s endangered wildlife committee designated the species as “threatened” more than a decade ago, and the federal government has put limits on the harvest. The total allowable catch for 2023 is 9,960kg, unchanged over the last 18 years."
"A few months after her first trip, Waihong returned to Lugu Lake. A teenage girl, Ladzu, had offered to teach her the Mosuo language, which is passed down orally, and introduce her to her family. Her visits grew longer and more frequent. She became godmother to Ladzu and her brother, Nongbu. Ladzu’s uncle, Zhaxi, a local character and successful entrepreneur, offered to build her a house. Thus she began to put down roots.  “I grew accustomed to shuttling between Singapore and Lugu Lake, navigating a hectic city life and a different rural rhythm in the mountains,” she says. Her longer stays – she now lives with the Mosuo for a few months, three or four times a year – gave her the chance to discover more about this private, often misunderstood community."
"In 1794 it was officially granted to the tribe by Massachusetts for their service during the revolutionary war. But after 1820, when Maine became its own state, colonialists changed its title, voiding the treaty. In the 1851 census there were 20 Passamaquoddy living there, in 1861 there were none.  By 2021, they had not only lost all but 130,000 acres of their original 3m. They hadn’t stepped foot on Pine Island in 160 years.  “The land was stolen from us and it’s been every chief’s goal ever since to return it,” said chief William Nicholas, 51, leader of the tribe’s Indian township reservation for the last 11 years, who spotted the advert on a shop noticeboard on 4 July last year.  In March, with a grant from conservation charities, the tribe raised $355,000, and finally bought the island back."
"The Batek are one of Malaysia’s three remaining tribal groups within the indigenous Orang Asli people. Traditionally a nomadic tribe, there are only 12 Batek settlements left, with most living in close proximity to the Kelantan rainforest their ancestors called home. Due to poor access to healthcare, rampant deforestation of their rainforest home and being surrounded by pesticides from the palm oil and rubber plantations which have poisoned the land and their water supply, the Batek population has been in decline in recent years.  For those still living in the infected Kuala Koh settlement, an atmosphere of terror has gripped the village. “I am very worried,” a villager, Adidas Om, 32, told reporters on the steps of Kuala Krai hospital where he had brought his two young daughters, Hoi, six, and Boi, five, who were both experiencing breathing difficulties. “Apart from my children, my neighbours are suffering from the same disease and some have died.”"
"Scott Schuyler doesn’t need to see the Skagit River to know something is wrong. As he walks down the river’s steep embankment, wet rock and moss under each step, he can hear the problem. “The river should be singing to us right now, it should be free flowing,” Schuyler says as cold February rain drops silently disappear into his quilted blue jacket. The riverbed below him, once home to one of Washington’s greatest rivers, sits eerily quiet and nearly empty of water, even in the middle of the state’s famously wet winters.  As Schuyler explains it: “The river has been stolen from us. It has been harvested for money.”  Schuyler is a member of the Upper Skagit Indian tribe, which has lived along the Skagit River for at least 8,400 years and considers it to be sacred. A century ago, Seattle’s public utility dammed the river in three spots, creating a hydroelectric complex that provides 18% of the city’s energy. On this particular two-mile stretch near the Canadian border, the entire river has been diverted into a hydroelectric tunnel, reducing this wide riverbed to a stretch of sleepy pools."
"Keeping salmon in her children’s diet is “an entire job”, says Georgiana Gensaw, a Yurok Tribe member and mother of four in Klamath Glen, California, a community whose only easily accessible food store is a fried chicken shop attached to a gas station a few miles away.  The nearest grocery store, Safeway in Crescent City, lies 24 miles away along a stretch of road frequently plagued by landslides and toppled redwoods – last summer it was closed for 20 hours a day after a washout – making queues to get through the roadworks up to five hours long.  As a lifelong reservation resident, Gensaw recalls when fresh food was abundant. “I grew up with fish patties, rice and fish, noodles and fish, salmon sandwiches, dried fish,” she remembers fondly. “We never understood how lucky we were, that it was going to go away.”"
"“The team’s name, which has been the Indianapolis Indians since 1902, will remain the same during the 2023 and 2024 seasons as the organization explores and activates programs with the Miami,” according to the release.  The Miami Nation of Indians of Indiana is one of the 100 largest tribes in the US, the team said. The tribe’s chief, Brian Buchanan, released a statement about the new partnership.  “We are grateful to the Indianapolis Indians for the opportunity to share our story with Hoosiers throughout central Indiana,” Buchanan said. “When the history of Indiana is studied, the major influence of Native American people is seen in the names of Indiana cities, state parks, rivers, food, celebrations and other cultural points of interest. We have encouraged the team to remain the Indianapolis Indians.”"
"Following the announcement of the court’s 7-2 decision, several tribal leaders commended the supreme court’s ruling, calling it a “major victory for Native tribes, children, and the future of our culture and heritage”.  In a joint statement, the Cherokee Nation principal chief, Chuck Hoskin Jr, Morongo Band of Mission Indians chairman, Charles Martin, Oneida Nation chairman, Tehassi Hill, and Quinault Indian Nation president, Guy Capoeman, said: “It is also a broad affirmation of the rule of law, and of the basic constitutional principles surrounding relationships between Congress and tribal nations.  “We hope this decision will lay to rest the political attacks aimed at diminishing tribal sovereignty and creating instability throughout Indian law that have persisted for too long.”"
"María Isaura Cuaran, an indigenous Siona woman, is displaying a rash that has appeared at the base of her neck. It is barely visible, but there nonetheless. Pulling her turquoise top off her left shoulder and tugging down on her bead necklace, Cuaran talks about “the company” and how, she alleges, it has affected the local river.  “Stomach problems, coughing, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, welts, little spots, little blotches, general malaise …”  Sitting next to Cuaran is Marleni Piaguaye. The two women appeared equally agitated, equally desperate to talk.  “More in the women, but some men too,” Cuaran says. “The children are the most affected.”"
"Lingaraj Azad, a leader of the Save Niyamgiri Committee, said the Dongria Kondh's campaign was ""not just that of an isolated tribe for its customary rights over its traditional lands and habitats, but that of the entire world over protecting our natural heritage"".  An alliance of local tribes has now formed to defend the Dongria Khondh. Kumity Majhi, a leader of the Majhi Kondh adivasi (indigenous people), said local communities would stop the mining ""whether or not the supreme court favour us"".  ""We, the Majhi Kondh adivasis, will help our Dongria Kondh brothers in protecting the mountains,"" he said.  India's rapid economic growth has generated huge demand for raw materials. Weak law enforcement has allowed massive environmental damage from mining and other extractive industries, according to campaigners."
"The reservation is home to two Native American tribes, the Assiniboine, or Nakoda, and the Gros Ventre, who refer to themselves as A’aninin or “People of the White Clay”, with a combined enrollment of 4,000 members.  “They’ve been neglecting us for over 23 years; we’ve exhausted all options,” Geno LeValdo, a member of the Fort Belknap Indian Community Council, told the Hill. “They just don’t seem like they care.”  Other Native American tribes, including the North Cheyenne Tribe on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation and the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, have filed similar lawsuits against the federal government over lack of providing adequate law enforcement services. The North Cheyenne Tribe filed their lawsuit on 18 July, this year."
"“We are opposing the dam because our ancestral lands are important to us. This is where we grew up. This is our home. If the dam is built, where will our future generations go?” said 61-year-old Dumagat-Remontado elder Nelly dela Carzada.  The Philippines has been pushing to create this dam since the 1970s in a bid to ensure water supply for Metro Manila, the country’s densely populated capital region composed of 16 cities and one town located some 65km downstream.  Several Metro Manila communities have experienced water shortages in recent years, due to a mix of issues like overpopulation, poor urban planning and climate change."
"Indonesian tribesman Muhammad Yusuf believes his conversion from animism to Islam in a government-supported programme will eventually make his life easier.  ""Thank God, the government now pays attention to us; before our conversion they didn't care,"" says Yusuf, the Islamic name he has adopted.  Yusuf is a member of the ""Orang Rimba"" tribe. His small community now gathers around a stilt-mounted wooden hut, while children inside wearing Islamic skullcaps and hijabs enthusiastically recite the Quran.  Not far away, other members of the tribe who remain faithful to the old ways stalk through palm oil trees in a desperate hunt for prey in an area that was once lush Sumatran rainforest."
"Arlan Melendez, chair of the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, said the tribe has been in contact with the White House to try to apply pressure to federal agencies to take some sort of action. The White House did not provide comment for this story.  “We’re kind of looking for some action. There hasn’t been any, especially on the massacre site, which is a big issue to the tribes. We’re also concerned about water and the environment and the cultural significance,” said Melendez. “When we talk about leaving something for our generations to come, we’re trying to do that.”  Mining projects have extracted wealth on Native lands for generations under the 1872 Mining Act, and have stolen lands under the Dawes Act of 1887, all while the government has levied taxes on Native Americans on their own land, said Melendez."
"Technology is very much part of the solution, analysts said, with drones and sensors able to monitor crops, soil moisture, weather conditions and irrigation systems, and digital platforms enabling farmers to share information and best practices.  Apps can also help consumers find the best deals for rice.  In East Java's Lamongan, one of Indonesia's rice-producing regions, 70-year-old farmer Salimah said extreme weather had made life more difficult.  Longer droughts had forced her to grow more crops that are resistant to dry weather, such as corn or sesame, even though they are often more expensive.  ""I plant green beans to keep my income ... Most farmers leave their land empty because the weather is too hot,"" she said."
"Jakarta resident Patricia Tambunan had it worse: Her stay in hospital was more than seven days, and the virus made the 28-year-old so nauseous that she vomited every time she ate or drank.   Mr Loh and Ms Tambunan are among tens of thousands of people across Southeast Asia who've been infected with dengue recently, with hundreds dying.  Governments in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia specifically have implemented measures such as bacteria-carrying mosquitoes and community campaigns, to name a few. But are they working? CNA takes a closer look at the three countries’ battle against the virus.  WHY IS DENGUE SUCH A CONCERN?  The World Health Organization (WHO) describes dengue as a viral infection caused by the dengue virus (DENV), transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes - specifically Aedes mosquitoes."
"With schools in Malaysia returning to home-based teaching and learning again, Jessica Teng is bracing for hectic weeks ahead juggling work and her three children's studies.   The corporate communications manager, who resides in Shah Alam, said each kid has four to five online classes a day, starting from 8am for the older kids in primary school and 9am for the youngest in kindergarten. Each class lasts about an hour.   “I’ll be half-helping my youngest and half-working, because the teacher needs them to interact and I have to encourage him to interact through his tablet,” she added.  Meanwhile, she has to check on her two older kids every 30 or 45 minutes."
"Ms Vanessa Lee, 27, moved from Singapore to Australia for her studies two years ago. Before she moved Down Under, she had never stepped foot into a public library in Singapore as she preferred to buy her own books.  But since she left Singapore, the environmental science undergraduate who currently resides in Melbourne has been borrowing three to six e-books every month via the Libby app.  The app allows users all over the world to download e-books and audiobooks onto their devices from libraries which they are a member of, so they can read or listen to them without an internet connection."
"Said Michael Kors during his orchid naming ceremony at the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 2016:  I’m a nature lover even though I’m a city boy. I have orchids all over my apartment in New York and I’m building a house in Florida. I’ll have orchids in the garden.  As the latest-named orchid sits comfortably in the National Orchid Garden, likely tucked away in a temperature-controlled glasshouse, will we see rows of Dendrobium Duke Duchess of Cornwall growing in the gardens of Buckingham Palace for British residents and tourists alike to gaze upon?  Or will the Prince of Wales have a pot at Clarence House, his official residence, where he can admire its beauty and recall its significance?"
"For 52-year-old Jasni Zakaria, it started when he was frustrated with the food options available in Finland where he has been living for the last 23 years. He resides in Jyväskylä, about four hours away from Helsinki.  “In Finland, it’s very difficult to get Asian food and they sell Chinese and Indian food but it’s not original,” said Jasni.  According to him, fried rice would often be too oily and curries would come from pre-packaged jars. It is also not spicy enough for his Singaporean taste buds.  “I cannot get the real taste. … I don’t care about the price, I just want good food that I cannot get!” he added."
"He has been telling the people around him that he is glad his family is safe, but the protection programme is suffocating. He has also been consuming alcohol, often during the daytime, while saying that he had more freedom working in Macau, the report said.  Mr Kim Han Sol and the rest of the family were reportedly residing in Macau at the time of his father's murder, and had worked as an employee at a nearby hotel there. The family had been living a life of exile from North Korea since 2001.  The trio's current whereabouts are unknown, although the respective governments of the Netherlands, China, the United States and a fourth unnamed nation had offered help to them, according to Cheollima Civil Defence, an organisation which is keeping the family under Pyongyang's radar. The group is believed to comprise North Korean dissidents."
"You, who withdrew from Boston College in August and returned to South Korea, was deemed to have displayed ""wanton and reckless"" behaviour and ""created life-threatening conditions"" for her boyfriend.  A more complete summary of the facts and events before and after Mr Urtula's death will be revealed in due course, said Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins.  ""I stand firmly behind this office's detailed presentation of the evidence to the Suffolk County grand jury and the returned indictment against Ms You,"" she was cited as saying by the Boston Globe.  The authorities are preparing to seek You's extradition from South Korea and are ""cautiously optimistic"" over her cooperation. The two countries share an extradition treaty that goes back to 1999."
"Judge Mabel Sheela then set Oct 10 for the facts of the case as well as sentencing for both of the accused.  She also ordered the bail amount of RM15,000 for Nurul Asyiqin and RM20,000 for Chua to be upheld.  Lawyer Abd Rahim Ali represented the two accused.  On Aug 16, both Nurul Asyiqin and Chua were charged and claimed trial at the Sessions Court for allegedly abusing the boy.  Chua is reportedly working in Singapore, but residing in Pasir Gudang. She has a valid passport and permit to be in Malaysia, her lawyer said.  The case gained public attention when videos of neighbours rescuing the victim from the accused went viral on social media."
"Singaporean Yvonne Lim was heading for a nap after sending her children to school when an earthquake struck Taiwan - the island’s strongest in 25 years.  Everything started shaking and the intensity got worse as the seconds dragged on. That is when she realised it was serious, said Ms Lim, a Mediacorp artiste who has been living with her family in Taipei for the past nine years.  “I ran downstairs to my living room. I forgot my handphone. I just forgot everything. It was so shaky and you could even barely walk in (a) straight line. It was like a scene from the movies that we watch,” she told CNA’s Singapore Tonight on Wednesday (Apr 3)."
"Mr Bill Lapschies, 104, displayed symptoms associated with the virus on March 5 and was quickly put into isolation at the Edward C. Allworth Veterans' Home in Lebanon, Oregon, where he resides.  Mr Lapschies was one of the first two residents at the home to test positive for the virus. The other victim, a man in his 90s, has since died, reported The Daily Mail.  The home has reported 16 Covid-19 cases till date, out of which eight patients have recovered, one has no symptoms, two are in critical condition and two have died. The other three patients are stable."
"Born in Pittsburgh, USA, he moved to Singapore when he was four. At age 12, he was sent to boarding school in the UK.  “I didn’t appreciate being shipped off to London at such a young age, but that’s when I discovered London’s museums and parks, and how immersed in history the world’s greatest cities that are two to three hundred years old are, while still remaining relevant and contemporary,"" Cheng told CNA Luxury.  ""The patina of certain items and places made me think about how people used to live, what their stories were. How were these things made? What were they meant to be used for? How did things use to be done? That’s why in my design work, it’s never just about the material, but also how it references a period of the past, how it alludes to a tradition of craftsmanship."""
"Norway's king may soon return home from Malaysia, palace says  OSLO - Norway's King Harald may return home from Malaysia in a few days following his hospitalisation, the Norwegian royal household said on Thursday.  ""His majesty the king's physician reports today that the king is improving,"" it said in a statement.  The 87-year-old monarch was on a private trip to the South East Asian country when he fell ill with an infection earlier this week.  The palace on Thursday said King Harald was expected to remain in hospital for a few more days before flying home, and that the government had asked Norway's military to assist with the travel."
"A representative for Portman confirmed to American publication People on Friday (Mar 8) they had split after the actress filed for dissolution in July, and said the former couple’s divorce was finalised last month in France – where they live with their children: Son Aleph, 12, and seven-year-old daughter Amalia.  Portman and Millepied were married for 11 years, and it was first reported in June he had allegedly cheated on the actress with a 25-year-old woman named Camille Etienne.  A source told Page Six the pair, who married in 2012, had first separated in 2022 but managed to work through their marital troubles."
"Yuwu’s character accepts the chance to make amends to his late wife – played by Jesseca Liu – and solve the mystery of a broken friendship, but also has run-ins with his past self.  Doesn’t that pose problems for the space-time continuum? Erm, guess we’ll have to watch the show to find out.  “If I really could travel through time, there are too many periods I would want to visit,” mused Yuwu, paralysed by the hypothetical possibility of meeting anyone in history, even his teenage self.  The 47-year-old was born and grew up in Guangzhou, China, where his family still lives. He moved to Singapore in his early 20s after winning the China round of Star Search Singapore in 1999, picking up a Mr Personality award while he was at it. Rising steadily to leading man status, he’s earned two Best Actor gongs and an All-Time Favourite Artiste trophy at the Star Awards over the years."
"Sewing was something Liam picked up from her seamstress mother when she was growing up in a suburb in the Klang Valley, although it wasn’t something she was immediately drawn to. “I grew up in Kajang, Malaysia, lived and led your normal SJKC/SMK (government public school) life. My mom was a trained seamstress, and I was around sewing machines a lot, but the loud sounds of the machines always stressed me out,” she recalled. “Fashion and fashion magazines were entertainment and escapism for me as with most teenage girls growing up.”  Liam’s first exposure to modelling began when she was scouted for a cover girl search in a teenage magazine at the age of 15. However, her parents looked dimly at this and forbade her to join. Nevertheless, she got callbacks from the magazine and started shooting editorials here and there for some part-time fun."
"Shakira, 46, lived with former Barcelona and Spain soccer star Gerard Pique for 11 years and the couple have two children. The singer, whose full name is Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll, moved to Miami after their separation.  Judge Jose Manuel del Amo Sanchez, who has handled other high-profile cases, will chair a panel of three judges who are set to hear more than 100 testimonies during the course of the trial, which is due to start at 10am (5pm Singapore time).  Spanish authorities have pursued other major celebrities over tax evasion including soccer players such as Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, Argentina's Lionel Messi and Brazilian-Spanish player Diego Costa. All settled and paid large fines."
"Former Singaporean actor Ix Shen has returned to Ukraine to help with humanitarian aid as part of a volunteer group.  The 50-year-old previously left his home in Ukraine for Poland last month after Russia invaded the country. He had been living in the capital city of Kyiv with his Ukrainian wife for four months.  The couple fled Kyiv as the Russian attacks intensified, and Mr Shen posted on Instagram after reaching Poland to reassure his followers that he was safe.  In an Instagram video posted last Friday (April 8), he said that he now resides in a safe place in Ukraine but did not reveal his exact location because of security reasons."
"The story of a university student from Chongqing who flew 1,600km to pick up her mother and take her back home for the upcoming Chinese New Year has gone viral in China, People’s Daily reported.  According to a video posted by Ms Li Qiushuang, her parents went to work in Fujian province over 20 years ago. Every year before the Spring Festival, they would return to Chongqing together.  However in 2024, due to her grandmother’s illness, Ms Li’s father returned to their home town early, leaving her mother alone in Jinjiang, Fujian, where she works at a shoe factory.  Over a video call, Ms Li’s mother told her daughter that she would not be coming home for the festive period this year. On the one hand, her mother wanted to earn more money, and on the other hand, it might be difficult for her to travel alone as she was not familiar with public transport."
"A new coach, new mentor and a new home – India’s P.V. Sindhu has overhauled her life in an all-out bid to land an Olympic badminton gold in Paris, after having to settle for silver and bronze in the previous two Games.  She is now in Bengaluru, India, far from Hyderabad, where she trained through most of her career, the highlights of which include bagging the singles silver in Rio 2016, bronze in Tokyo and being crowned world champion in 2019.  The move in October was deemed essential for Sindhu, who wanted to be closer to her new mentor, Prakash Padukone, the Indian badminton great and father of Bollywood superstar Deepika Padukone."
"“Fritz Hansen is a big fan of patina; we like materials such as leather and wood for the furniture to get old, to get patina,” said Dario Reicherl, CEO of Fritz Hansen Asia, on natural materials’ timeworn beauty that provided the inspiration.  Releasing a perfume may not be the most conventional way to market furniture but then Reicherl does not conform. “Marketing in the furniture world is extremely conservative, with very, very little innovation. I consider that extremely boring,” said the Italian who has resided in Singapore for 15 years.  He handles the Australasian market for the 150-year-old brand, whose iconic pieces such as the Egg armchair and Series 7 chair designed by Arne Jacobsen have become synonymous with timeless Scandinavian design. Under Reicherl’s unorthodox leadership, regional sales have increased five-fold over nine years."
"Next time you're at the market, look around because there's a chance you might bump into Taiwanese host Matilda Tao.  At a recent press conference in Taipei for her new show, the 54-year-old star revealed that she's been living in Singapore with her 15-year-old son aka 'Little Dragon', who has been studying at an international school here since January.  Matilda said she's been commuting between Singapore and Taiwan, and will be heading to the United States in May for her 18-year-old daughter Dou Dou's high school graduation ceremony.   Meanwhile, Matilda's husband, Taiwanese actor Li Liren, 50, is alone in Taiwan with their two dogs."
"Children without Malaysian citizenship face many obstacles when it comes to schooling, access to government health services, and even the ability to cross borders and meet their families.  Mdm Teoh said that her son could not attend a national school as it has to wait for all spots to be filled by citizens before opening the remaining to others.  She had to send her son to an international school, which costs up to RM30,000 (US$7,146) per year in fees.  “I am not able to save much for my retirement,” said the cybersecurity specialist who was originally from Kuching, Sarawak, but now resides in Petaling Jaya, Selangor.

"It was a rainy morning in the Limbang estate in Choa Chu Kang, and Brian Ang appeared to be in a rush. But the 25-year-old resident of Limbang was enthusiastic to share his thoughts about his Member of Parliament (MP) Lawrence Wong, a man he described as ""friendly"" and ""remarkable"".   Mr Wong, who is the MP for the Limbang ward under the Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC and also Finance Minister, was on Thursday (Apr 14) named the leader of the fourth generation, or 4G, of Singapore's political leadership.  The announcement paves the way for him to become the country's next Prime Minister."
"Indian national and Singapore permanent resident Thirumal Pavithran, 25, failed to register on time for NS and defaulted on NS obligations while completing his secondary and university education in India.  The total amount of time he spent outside Singapore was five years, seven months and 16 days.  Thirumal, who just finished serving NS last month, pleaded guilty to four charges under the Enlistment Act.   The court heard that he was born in India and became a permanent resident of Singapore in June 1997, when he was three years old.  He studied in primary and secondary schools in Singapore from 2001 to 2009, but left the country for India to continue his studies in May 2009."
"Late on Jan 31, the government said Bibi had been transferred to her home on the outskirts of Islamabad from Adiala jail.  “The chief commissioner, Islamabad Capital Territory is pleased to declare the residence of convict Mst. Bushra Bibi... as sub-jail, as on Jan 31, till further orders,” read an order seen by AFP.  The Khan home – a rambling bungalow in a large compound surrounded by high concrete walls – is in the plush Bani Gala area of the capital.  Pakistan goes to the polls on Feb 8 in a ballot already marred by allegations of rigging, with Khan barred from running and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party subject to a massive crackdown."
"Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi said he was unhurt and appealed for calm and restraint after a drone attack on his residence on Sunday (Nov 7) as political tensions mounted in the country.  The attack in Baghdad's Green Zone - the first to target the residence of Mr Kadhemi, who has been in power since May last year - came as Iraq's political parties wrangle over who will run the next government after last month's elections.  That vote saw the Conquest (Fatah) Alliance, the political arm of the pro-Iran Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network, suffer a substantial drop in its parliamentary seats, leading the group to denounce the outcome as fraud.  No group has yet claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack, which left six members of Mr Kadhemi's personal protection force wounded, security sources said."
"The paparazzi eagerly snap shots of random moving trucks in the vicinity of the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem. Political cartoonists are portraying Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, his wife, Sara, and their elder son, Yair, as squatters.  And suspicions that Netanyahu might be reluctant to leave the stately home where he has lived for the past 12 years were bolstered this week when he hosted Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the United Nations, at the official residence as if he were still running the show.  Unlike in Washington, there is no set time by which an outgoing Israeli premier must move out and hand the house over to the victor and it can often take weeks, though it's not as if the Netanyahu family has nowhere to go. Among their private residences is a home in the seaside town of Caesarea."
"New Zealand paceman Kyle Jamieson will be rested from the current ODI series against Bangladesh after experiencing a stiff hamstring on his return home from the test tour, New Zealand Cricket said on Monday.  The towering quick bowled only four overs in the second test win against Bangladesh in Mirpur this month and missed Sunday's 44-run victory in the opening ODI in Dunedin.  He will miss the final matches of the series in Nelson on Wednesday and Napier on Saturday but should be available for the T20 series starting on Dec. 27 in Napier.  Wellington Firebird fast bowler Ben Sears will remain with the squad after being called up as injury cover for Jamieson."
"Turkey on Thursday freed an Israeli couple who had been arrested for photographing President Tayyip Erdogan's residence in Istanbul and accused of spying, an allegation denied by Israel.  The couple's release spurred the first conversation between the countries' leaders in years.  Mordi and Natali Oknin were detained on Nov 9.  A Turk was also arrested on espionage charges, state-run news agency Anadolu said.  Their family said the pair, drivers for Israel's biggest bus company, had been on vacation.  The Oknins' case became a cause celebre in Israel, whose relations with Turkey have been strained as Erdogan has championed the Palestinian cause."
"As the number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia rises due to the Omicron variant, voters in Johor are wary of the upcoming state polls.  Many of them believe that the last thing needed at this point of time is an election.  Mr Daniel Cheh, 37, who resides in Kulai, said many businesses in Johor are struggling to stay afloat due to COVID-19, especially since borders with Singapore are still closed.  “The last thing we need now is an election. It is very unnecessary and really just a waste of time and money,” he told CNA.  Mr Cheh said he did not know if he would cast his vote during the polls, and would look at the COVID-19 situation first. "
"He was in California and working in banking at the time, having moved from Singapore to the United States in 1986 and living there since then with his wife and two adult children.  But the incident marked the start of a journey that took him to the Kurdistan region of Iraq in 2016. Today, home for him is Zakho, a small city of over 200,000 people.  Willy is co-founder of Habibi International, a humanitarian organisation providing healthcare and education for internally displaced persons (IDPs) — those who are forced from their homes but remain within the same country — and refugees.  He is one of four Singaporeans living in unusual places who are featured in the On The Red Dot series, Are You The Only Singaporean Here?"
"The ballot papers on Thursday were transported in a suitcase by Sarawak-born Mohd Hafeez A Jaz, 36, who resides and works in Singapore.  The 1ThirdMedia Movement volunteer took a bus from Woodlands at 12.40pm and arrived at the Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal at about 1.50pm via the vaccinated travel lane.  Upon arrival in Johor Bahru on Thursday, Mohd Hafeez underwent several procedures at the checkpoint, including an on-arrival COVID-19 screening test.   He then handed over the luggage containing the postal ballot papers to an Undi18 volunteer, Mandeep Singh, at about 2.15pm at the bus terminal.  “I consider this as charity work to help and facilitate Malaysians in Singapore fulfil their responsibilities as registered voters,” said Mohd Hafeez, who said the responsibility entrusted to him by the 1ThirdMedia Movement to bring the ballot papers to Malaysia was not a burden at all."
"Pensioner Zulkifli Abu Bakar, 57 who resides in Selangor, told CNA that the government must do more to help the lower income population in Malaysia, especially the B-40 (bottom 40 per cent) to cope with the increase in prices of goods such as rice, eggs, and chicken.  He said that subsidised cooking oil and sugar are difficult to get at times, with some stores limiting the number of packs of these items that can be purchased.    “It is difficult for retirees like us and those of the lower income groups because our income is not high. When the cost of living is high, social issues such as theft, suicide and crimes will also increase. The government has to pay serious attention to this and not just talk in parliament."

"Food-delivery company Deliveroo and ride-hailing firm Gojek tied up on Tuesday to offer savings and rewards to customers on both platforms.  This is the second collaboration here between a food-delivery company and a ride-hailing service, following Foodpanda and Tada’s partnership in April.  Foodpanda and the blockchain-based ride-hailing company are granting their users discounted fares and loyalty programme subscriptions across both platforms.  Some transport analysts and economists The Straits Times spoke to said the Deliveroo-Gojek deal is aimed strategically at strengthening these companies’ foothold in the food-delivery and ride-hailing markets, which are dominated by Grab.  Professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School said that the food-delivery and ride-hailing markets are currently undergoing consolidation to create “shake-ups” across different sectors."

"Singapore's national water agency PUB is teaming up with the University of California (UCLA) and a UCLA-linked startup to build the world's largest plant that removes carbon dioxide from seawater and the atmosphere.  This comes after a successful pilot of such a plant here that was launched in April 2023 by PUB, UCLA and Equatic, a company spun out of research at the university.  When fully completed in 18 months, the new plant at PUB’s research and development facility in Tuas will be equipped to remove 10 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per day from seawater and the atmosphere.   This is 100 times more than the existing pilot plant, which can remove 0.1 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per day, PUB, UCLA and Equatic said in a joint statement on Tuesday (Feb 27)."
"A cryptocurrency exchange has teamed up with Singapore charities to enable donations to be made in digital assets.

"A man who invested S$49,500 (US$37,100) on a purported Australian foreign exchange trading platform lost all the money after the platform and its website was supposedly hacked due to a loophole in the security system.

"NEW YORK: SoftBank Group Corp, the Japanese conglomerate led by Masayoshi Son, invested about US$16 billion in WeWork in the years that led up to the flexible-workspace company's bankruptcy, according to Reuters calculations.

In 2019, SoftBank launched Vision Fund 2 with its own capital.  Since SoftBank first wrote a US$4.4 billion check to WeWork in early 2017, the Japanese conglomerate invested nearly US$12 billion more of equity and debt in WeWork through its various entities, including its Vision Funds, according to regulatory filings, press releases and data analysed by Reuters."

"1914 – 1943: FROM RICKSHAWS TO TRISHAWS  The trishaw evolved from the rickshaw – a small, two-wheeled cart pulled by a man.   Originating from Japan, rickshaws were first seen in Singapore in the 1880s. They were one of the earliest modes of transport in Singapore, alongside steam trams and bullock carts.  Rickshaw rides were inexpensive and ideal for short journeys through crowded inner-city streets.  The first trishaws were officially registered in Singapore in 1914, according to Roots, a website by the National Heritage Board (NHB). Known as “pedal rickshaws”, these early trishaws were essentially modified rickshaws attached to bicycles.   But the initial batch of 15 trishaws was said to be “crudely constructed” and did not last long on Singapore’s streets, according to the National Library Board’s (NLB) Infopedia website."

Some rare Okamotoyaki wares are also used as utensils on the Thousand-Year Story tourist train. People have driven from Kansai or Kyushu just to buy Okamotoyaki pottery.

"HOW MUCH R&D GOES INTO THE PRODUCTS YOU SELL?  The longest R&D we did was for Miebianbian bakmie noodles. It took four months. Our Miebianbian bakmie noodle recipe originated from Medan. After we did R&D for the first month, I almost gave up. It was very tedious. We ate and threw away a lot of bakmie noodles. I never ate so many noodles all my life. There is also no bakmie noodles supplier in Singapore. Most are made in-house or they use mee kia as a replacement instead. I made my foodie friends come by for many rounds of food tasting. I soon realised that when I wouldn’t hear back from them, I failed.  They just couldn’t bear to tell me. We revised the recipe at least eight times until one day, my foodie friends couldn’t stop calling me to ask me to release the bakmie noodles so they could order them. Only then, I knew we had succeeded. The R&D ended there. During the process, we broke a 30-litre commercial dough mixer within four months and I gained a few kilos. The weight is still on me right now."

The Singapore branch is an 85-seater located in Boat Quay, and is Singapore’s first Korean restaurant specialising in Andong jjimdak (Korean braised chicken), which apparently originated from the city of Andong. It’s a spicy dish featuring chicken braised in a sweet and savoury soya-based sauce, spiked with both dried and fresh whole chilli peppers. It’s usually served with glass noodles."
"Only one of the 14 items was not linked to Kapoor – a 12th-century statue, titled “The Child-Saint of Sambandar,” that originates from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Purchased from the late art dealer William Wolff, the item is being returned after museum research found an historical image of the work in an Indian temple, a detail not included in the statue’s documentation, said Mitzevich.  The National Gallery of Australia said it has introduced a “provenance assessment framework” to help identify items that may have been “stolen, illegally excavated, exported in contravention of the law of a foreign country, or unethically acquired.”"
"Malaysia-born actor Henry Golding appears to be back in his home state of Sarawak. On Oct 29, the Crazy Rich Asians star took to Instagram to upload a picture of himself enjoying a bowl of kolo mee, a dish that originated from Sarawak, and a cup of iced Milo at Chong Choon Cafe – an eatery in the city of Kuching.  In his caption, he wrote: ""If you know, you know"", along with an emoji of the Malaysian flag. His wife, wellness coach Liv Lo Golding, promptly replied, ""I know!""  Golding's post has been met with a warm reception from Malaysians welcoming him back, with comments coming from the likes of model Larissa Ping, who commented ""Welcome home!"", and singer Zee Avi who commented, ""He said one (bowl of) kolo mee, guys!"""
"Habitat Betta fish originated from Thailand but can be found in nearby countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Wild bettas live in shallow, freshwater areas such as rice paddies, stagnant ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Being used to Asian climates, they prefer warm water around 80º Fahrenheit. Colder water can cause them to become lethargic, stop eating, or become more prone to disease or infection. Their diet mainly consists of plankton, crustaceans, and larvae.  Because their usual habitats are extremely low in oxygen, bettas have evolved to breathe air at the water’s surface. This ability develops over time: hatchlings rely on their gills, but adults gulp air and capture the oxygen from it using something called a labyrinth organ, which is attached to the gills and functions similarly to a human lung."
"According to the National Library Board's Infopedia, the origins of the dish dates back more than 2,000 years in China.  Yusheng is believed to have originated from the Guangdong province, where fishermen along the coast of Guangzhou celebrated Renri, the seventh day of CNY, by feasting on their fresh catches. Renri means “every man’s birthday”, signifying that people become a year older on this day.  The earliest known written documentation of the dish can be traced back to the Zhou dynasty in 823 BCE, describing how these fishermen would finely cut strips of fish. It became popular after the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) that poems were written in praise of the dish."
"I grew up in Amritsar, India, where ginger was used in many traditional dishes, from shami kebabs (small meat patties) to pindi chole (spiced chickpeas). And now that I’m a chef, this flavourful root is the lifeblood of my cooking.  Originating in Southeast Asia, ginger has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years. It’s loaded with nutrients that are said to benefit your body and brain — for example, in the ayurvedic healing system, it’s used to relieve nausea. It’s primarily popular, however, for its fragrance and flavour.   Some of my earliest memories are of the aroma of ginger as my mother made my favourite foods — adraki gobi (a wintery cauliflower dish) and mutton pulao (a celebration pilaf). Of course, it’s not just India that features ginger in its cuisine. In Japan, for instance, it’s pickled and served alongside sushi, while in China it’s used with garlic as a base for many stir-fried dishes."
"Goya, or bitter gourd, originates from tropical Asia. The vegetable is said to have been introduced to what is now Okinawa Prefecture early in the 15th century.  Okinawans call stir-fry dishes chanpuru, and their famous dish called goya chanpuru is made by stir-frying goya with ingredients such as pork and tofu.  A recipe for goya chanpuru appeared in The Yomiuri Shimbun in 1990. The recipe uses only goya and tofu to keep things simple, although the Okinawan style also uses pork and eggs.  The dish nowadays is popular nationwide. Goya became well known especially after it was featured in the NHK TV drama series Chura-san, which aired in 2001. Goya vines have also come to be grown in many households across Japan as a ""green curtain"" to keep the summer sunshine from windows."
"Nasi ambeng is a traditional Javanese dish served at important occasions like weddings and Ramadan, and eaten after religious celebrations. It is a lavish, communal platter of steamed rice and dishes like chicken curry, sambal goreng (spicy fried tempeh and long beans), beef rendang, urap (a vegetable and coconut dish) and lots more.  “Nasi ambeng is time-consuming and labour-intensive, which is why it is hardly available outside of homes. It is a culture we, the Javanese diaspora, continue to preserve. To suddenly see it labelled as Nyonya really hit a raw nerve among the Malay community,” explained Azimin.  Violet Oon Singapore later apologised for having “insensitively used the name of a symbolic dish for a Nyonya interpretation that failed to articulate or acknowledge the rich significance and origins of Nasi Ambeng which originated from Java, Indonesia”."
"A spicy introduction Chilis weren’t always in China, says Brian Dott, a history professor at Whitman College and author of The Chile Pepper in China: A Cultural Biography. Originating in Central and South America, Capsicum plants were unknown in China until around the 16th century, when a boom in exploration and trade brought chilis to the Chinese mainland.  The first written record of chili in China dates from 1591—and it isn’t exactly a rave review. Gao Lian, a playwright who lived near what is now Shanghai, wasn’t “all that excited about it as a condiment or a medicine,” Dott says of his account. Instead, he used it as a decorative plant."
"Bo bia ngot is a snack prepared right after a customer orders, so there's no doubt of its freshness. It consists of two pieces of lumpia wrappers, stuffed with blocks of crispy sugar candies, shredded coconut meat and a good sprinkle of black sesame seeds. Before wrapping, the seller adds some drops of grapefruit flower extract. A big roll costs 10,000 dong, which seems no cost at all. If you find this size too big, you can order two small rolls for the same price.  Nguyen Van Minh from the northern province of Vinh Phuc said he started making rice papers for making sweet summer rolls in 1998. Every day, his family makes 5,000 rice papers to sell to bo bia ngot vendors.  Bo bia ngot is popular in many cities and provinces of the country. The dish originates from China and is also popular in countries like Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, according to Minh."
"After seeing the myth, experience the reality: feel the thrill of getting up close to a real dragon.  The bearded dragon, or pogona, originates from Australia. Its name stems from its ""beard"" - the underside of its throat - which can turn black and inflate if it is under threat or spots a potential foe. When threatened, pogonas also open their mouths and hiss intimidatingly, adding to their dragonish appearance.  But not to worry - the pogona at Singapore Zoo is a friendly creature. You can meet it at 10.15am and 1.30pm (20 minutes per session) on weekends and Dec 25."
"Godzilla and Bobo the green iguanas  Basking in the sun, Godzilla enjoys a glistening spray in its enclosure.  The reptile originates from tropical Latin America. It was introduced to Singapore via the exotic pet trade and has been sighted around the island since the turn of the 21st century.  Green iguanas rescued by Acres are typically abandoned pets. In one case, the charity found one chucked into a veterinary clinic dumpster, said Ms Anbarasi  While there appears to be a feral population of green iguanas in Sungei Tengah near Acres, both Godzilla and Bobo will not be released into the wild because they are considered non-native."
"Altang roes don't have much taste themselves and it is the broth that determines the taste. Though the broth looks spicy due to its flaming red color, the overall taste is refreshing - as Koreans would say - as the dish is cooked with seafood. Added vegetables, including bean sprouts, add more texture and colour to the soup.  After feasting on the pollack roes, drinking up the remaining broth is a must. The broth is filled with the eggs - the bits of the roes - as they break up little by little when being cooked.  The soup originates from Gangwon Province, where pollack is commonly found thanks to the cold water. Eaten with a bowl of rice, the soup serves as a hearty meal on a cold day. It is also commonly enjoyed with drinks, especially soju.  In South Korea, pollack roe are frequently sold separately at the fishmonger's section of supermarkets."
"In the early days of the British settlement, coffee was brought to Singapore by the immigrants as far back as during the founding years of modern Singapore,” said Victor Mah, President, Singapore Coffee Association.  What we know as “kopi” is a “unique recipe” that came to Singapore and Malaysia from Hainan and Fujian in China, Mah continued. “Commonly known as Nanyang coffee, it has not changed much since the day it (arrived) here in Singapore, preserving its roots.”  This coffee is mainly made up of Robusta beans, and “the roasting methods use butter, margarine and sugar. Even corn was sometimes added to enhance the flavour,” Mah explained.

Tempeh has always been a staple at our dining table. My family is of Javanese descent and tempeh originates from Java. We have it fresh and homemade, never from the stores. It’s like rice – the meal just isn’t complete without tempeh.   We often have plant-based dishes without realising they were plant-based. A simple meal of stir-fried vegetables with rice, sayur lodeh with tempeh and sambal is a complete meal without meat, fish or poultry.

Many are confident that with so much content available, there is no shelf life to its popularity.   Mr Jeff Ayers, who has been working at comic book store Forbidden Planet for nearly 30 years, said manga’s popularity comes in waves, but the selection available today is unparalleled.  When he started at the Manhattan outlet, items imported from Japan fit inside just one glass cabinet.   Now, around a quarter of the store’s floor space is dedicated to manga and items related to the genre.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/what-theyre-eating-in-athens	Açaí island bowl: Happy Blender Originating in Brazil, açaí bowls have long been a favourite in California, and are making waves here, too. Açaí, a sour superfruit packed with vitamins and antioxidants, is frozen, blended and served with healthy toppings. At Happy Blender, they blitz açaí with organic coconut milk and pineapple, topping it with kiwi and banana, Greek honey (or agave syrup for vegans) and granola with dried fruit.  Pistachio mousse: Margot Margot is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and this dessert has earnt it a lot of fans. The dish starts with a base of pistachio crumb and praline, followed by caramelised sour cherries and a generous scoop of sour cherry sorbet. A pistachio sablé then covers the sorbet, followed by a whipped ganache with white chocolate and pistachio praline. The whole thing is then sprinkled with caramelised chopped pistachios and more cherries.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/where-to-go-thai-tattoo-cultural-significance-master	Originating in Southeast Asia, sak yants (derived from the word yantra, meaning Buddhist psalms and sacred scriptures weaved into geometric designs) were once a way to shield warriors marching into battle, making them invincible against arrows. In modern times, sak yants have morphed into markers of mafia and gangsters, who use the tattoos’ protective blessings to perform acts of crime. “This is why I designed the ha taew, or five rows,” explains sak yant master, Ajarn Noo Kanpai, referring to five rows of Buddhist scripture (found in Jolie’s tattoo), starting the day Buddha was born and ending with his enlightenment. “Ha taew is meant to bring positive and balanced blessings into people's lives.”
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/lifestyle/dirty-bun-singapore-messiest-where-to-find-1972331	The “dirty” or “messy” bun is the latest food fad that Singaporeans are handing over money for en masse. At last count, at least 10 bakeries and cafes have recently rolled out their versions, including BreadTalk, Keong Saik Bakery, Swee Heng 1989 and Yamazaki Boulangerie.  No, dirty buns don’t come with a side of buzzing flies or salmonella. Originating in China and quickly spreading to Taiwan, Korea and Malaysia, these offensively named baked goods are filled with cream or custard and dusted with chocolate or matcha powder, and are named for the resulting effect they have on the hands and faces of their eaters.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/deconstructing-ratatouille	Aubergines burnished to an almost obsidian sheen by the scorching Mediterranean sun. Tomatoes picked when warm to the touch. Waxy peppers and firm courgettes, cooked in garlic and a handful of fragrant herbs. When done properly — using the finest, freshest ingredients — ratatouille is a glorious thing.  Originating in Nice, it’s a dish that sings of Provençal summers. It’s not made in winter, it’s not made with airfreighted vegetables, and the tomatoes absolutely do not come in a tin. But don’t think, though, that cooks in Provence have been making this stew for many hundreds of years; ratatouille, as we know it, is a much more recent invention.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/discovering-stories-scotlands-experimental-spirits-seaweed-rum-pea-vodka	A herbal remedy originating in Switzerland in the 18th century, absinthe became popular in France after the Great French Wine Blight, which devastated vineyards in the 1860s. But with an alcohol content of as much as 74%, it’s a drink with a reputation — and as its popularity grew, it was demonised by both the temperance movement and the wine industry. Finally, in 1915, absinthe was banned in France, having already been outlawed in several other countries around the world. But never in Scotland. “We don’t like to ban alcohol here,” says Pete, with a wry smile.  Pete and his business partner, Richard Pierce, run Lost Loch Spirits, one of several pioneering outfits taking Scottish spirits in an exciting new direction. This land of whisky-lovers is now home to a new generation of artisan distillers, producing everything from vodka and rum to vermouth and eau de vie. There’s even a Scottish gin trail, curated by Visit Scotland.
https://cnaluxury.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/why-wagyu-expensive-190166	Despite its recent introduction in the early 1900s (following the Meiji Restoration), wagyu has quickly evolved from a prohibited protein to a globally coveted luxury food item – famed for its quality beef and exceptionally intense marbling that are the result of precision animal husbandry.  And while there are essentially four breeds of “wa-gyu” (which roughly translates to mean Japanese cow) – namely the Japanese black, brown, poll and shorthorn – a number of prefectural standouts have since earned serious recognition, the most internationally renowned being Kobe beef, derived from the Tajima-gyu from Hyogo Prefecture. It is also said to be one of the hardest to procure outside of Japan; a black cow (kuroge) breed that is produced in notoriously small numbers.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/explore-globe-beer	Mark: Different regions will have different yeasts available… you start tampering with each of the four ingredients – that underscores the spatial perspective.  One of the examples is India pale ales, or IPAs. When Britain sent beer over to India [in colonial times,] the beer was spoiling before it got there. They found out that adding more hops preserved it longer.  They also found that people preferred the taste of beer from Burton on Trent. The water was harder.  Nancy: That’s because of calcium and choloride. Now, compare that to pilsners originating in the Czech Republic. Their water is soft and pretty much has no mineral composition… so the result is something that most lager drinkers will call clean and crisp.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/maya-foods	Avocados and Guacamole The avocado, originating in southern Mexico and Guatemala, is loved for its rich taste and creamy texture and was a treasured crop of the ancient Maya. Even today a person from Antigua Guatemala is called a panza verde, or green belly, because of the region's reliance on avocados in hard times.Combined with chilis, garlic, cilantro, onions, and lime or lemon, avocados become guacamole, a sumptuous appetizer. Don’t expect to find lots of Hass avocados in the Maya world—there are many other varieties, most of which are bigger.In 1917, Wilson Popenoe, a California Avocado Association explorer, reported why Guatemalan avocados are best: “The flesh is of a deeper yellow color, smoother, more buttery [in] texture, and richer [in] flavor than any varieties yet known in the United States.”
https://edition.cnn.com/style/rome-palatine-hill-archaeology-discovery/index.html	A five-year dig into the side of Rome’s Palatine Hill yielded treasure last week when archaeologists discovered a deluxe banquet room dating from around the first or second century BC, featuring a sizable, intact and brightly colored wall mosaic.  Estimated to be around 2,300 years old, the work is part of a larger aristocratic mansion, located near the Roman Forum, that has been under excavation since 2018.  Almost five meters long (16.4 ft) and featuring depictions of vines, lotus leaves, tridents, trumpets, helmets and mythological marine creatures, the mosaic scene was painstakingly created using mother of pearl, shells, corals, shards of precious glass and flecks of marble. The piece is framed by polychrome crystals, spongy travertine, and exotic, ancient Egyptian blue tiles.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/oregon-truffle-dog-championship-photos	You might have seen, or more likely, smelled truffles being shaved delicately over pasta at an upscale restaurant. The valuable fungus, which grows underground near the trunks of trees, is prized for its earthy flavor and has become a point of pride on fine dining menus, signaling indulgence and luxury.  The truffle’s road from the ground to your plate is possible thanks to dogs.  Like dogs that sniff out drugs, human remains, and elephant ivory, truffle dogs are trained to find the underground fungi. The most prized truffle-hunting breed is the Lagatto Romagnolo, a curly-haired water retriever originating in Italy and often bred specifically for truffle hunting, but just about any dog can be trained. It’s basic conditioning, experts say: Let the dog smell the truffle, then link that scent to a reward.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/history-of-apples	Apples: Sour Enough to ‘Make a Jay Scream’ Apples, taxonomically, are members of Rosaceae, the Rose family, along with such other yummy edibles as pears, plums, peaches, cherries, strawberries, and raspberries. DNA analysis indicates that apples originated in the mountains of Kazakhstan, where the wild Malus sieversii—the many-times great-grandparent of Malus domestica, the modern domesticated apple—still flourishes.  There’s a lot to be said for domestication. Though Henry David Thoreau insisted that he much preferred the wild apple (“of spirited flavor”) to the civilized versions found in Massachusetts orchards, even he admitted that the occasional spirited bite was “sour enough to set a squirrel’s teeth on edge and make a jay scream.” The truth is that wild apples – grown from seeds—are generally pretty awful.
https://edition.cnn.com/style/china-sanxingdui-relics-exhibition-nationalism-palace-museum-hong-kong/index.html	There’s something about the “Faces of Sanxingdui” — as this collection of sculptures is being billed — that feels both familiar and alien. Currently on display at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, they may appear Mayan or Aztec to the untrained eye, but these over-3,000-year-old sculptures weren’t unearthed anywhere near Mesoamerica’s ancient civilizations. They were discovered on China’s Chengdu Plain, at an archeological dig site called Sanxingdui (which translates as “three star mound”).  Thought to be the largest and oldest site left by the Shu kingdom, a civilization in southwestern China once only hinted at in myths and legends, Sanxingdui was not discovered until the 1920s, when a farmer stumbled across objects while digging an irrigation ditch. The site has since been found to contain the ruins of an ancient city made up of residences, sacrificial pits and tombs enclosed by high dirt walls. Archaeologists from the Sanxingdui Museum say the city was established some 4,800 to 2,800 years ago, until it was abandoned around 800 BC for unknown reasons.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bamboo-mathematicians	In the late 1960s, a species of bamboo called Phyllostachys bambusoides–commonly known as the Chinese Mainland Bamboo or Japanese Timber Bamboo–burst into flower. The species originated in China, was introduced to Japan, and later into the United States and other countries. And when I say it flowered, I mean it flowered everywhere. Forests of the plant burst into bloom in synchrony, despite being separated by thousands of miles. If, like me, you missed it, you will probably not live to see it happen again. The flowers released pollen into the wind, and the fertilized plants then produced seeds that fell to the ground. The magnificent bamboo plants, which can grow 72 feet tall, then all promptly died. Their seeds later sprouted and sent up new plants. The new generation is now close to fifty years old and has yet to grow a single flower. They won’t flower till about 2090.
https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kyudo-ancient-japanese-archery-young-singaporeans-218276	Jeremy and his peers practice kyudo, an ancient Japanese martial art that originated from the samurais in feudal Japan. Steeped in philosophical influences from Shinto and Zen Buddhism, kyudo translates literally to “the way of the bow”.  “I think for most people who are introduced to kyudo for the first time, they may find that there is a lot to take in. There is a lot that goes into refining the art to pursuing perfection,” Jeremy told Channel NewsAsia.  The distinctly ceremonial martial art involves five archers entering a dojo in lockstep while performing eight stages of deliberate and graceful movements. The shooting process emphasises not only dexterity, but emotional mastery and sense of being.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/brownies-or-blunts-marijuana-experimentation-is-on	Still, people have been using marijuana for thousands of years. The plant originated in Central Asia, where two subspecies were popularly known: the psychoactive Cannabis sativa and the non-psychoactive C. sativa L., commonly known as hemp, from which the ancient Chinese made cloth and shoes.  From Asia, marijuana travelled across the globe, finally arriving in the U.S. In the 19th century. It was first known mostly to druggists, who included it in a range of patent medicines, variously—and probably accurately—advertised as cures for nervousness and melancholy.  The practice of smoking it seems to have been introduced to the U.S. in the early 20th century by Mexican immigrants. When American legislators finally noticed this, they outlawed it.

We’re not talking about the sugary Auntie Anne’s stuff or crunchy, salted airplane snacks, but authentic Brezeln that originated in the southern German region.  How do you know they are authentic? When they’re made by an actual German person, of course.

The pair, who are very close, enjoy chatting before bed so despite having her own bedroom, Chantalle prefers bunking in with mum.  But with her increasingly busy work schedule and irregular hours, she decided it would be more conducive to have her own space.  Last year, she renovated her bedroom, along with some parts of their abode, and finally moved in.  Chantalle and Meijiao have been living in a rented one-storey black-and-white conservation house for the past decade.  The semi-detached house, which Chantalle reckons is at least 100 years old, consists of a living room, kitchen, dining room, two bedrooms and a separate bathroom and toilet. A third room – Chantalle’s walk-in wardrobe – was recently added by converting part of the backyard.

"When Caryn Lim and her husband, Dr Tan Yung Khan, a urologist, first got married in 2015, starting a family was not on their minds. They were in their twenties and forties respectively and were enjoying their careers and travels.     Just as they contemplated starting a family, Lim found out she had endometriosis.  Endometriosis is a condition where cells similar to the lining of the woman’s uterus grow outside the uterus – it can affect the ovaries, fallopian tubes and tissue lining of the pelvis.  Although the tissue is growing in places it shouldn’t be, the endometriosis tissues thicken, break down and bleed every menstrual cycle. The condition can cause cysts and pain for women, especially during their periods."

"The death of Khdour, a Florida-born US citizen, just weeks after another 17-year-old American citizen was shot under strikingly similar circumstances in the occupied West Bank, has underscored the frustrations among Palestinian-Americans who say the United States is doing little to respond to the deaths of their loved ones.  Videos from the aftermath of the February 10 shooting show several people rushing to the damaged car, pulling Khdour’s limp, bloodied body out from the shattered glass. Khdour died hours later at a Ramallah hospital, his family said.  The Israel Defense Forces referred questions about the case to the Israeli Security Agency, known as the Shin Bet, which did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.  “He didn’t do nothing at all, he was just enjoying his day,” Khdour’s older brother, Hamed, told CNN. “I just want justice for my brother, that’s it.”"

The criticism has largely focused on the way in which Chao has associated her government office and title with her father, James S.C. Chao, the founder of the Foremost Group, a US-based shipping company with business ties to China.  During her time in the Trump administration, Elaine Chao has sat with her father for Chinese-language media interviews, appeared with him at an award ceremony and at a photoshoot listed on her schedule with him and other Foremost Group employees at the media center of the Department of Transportation, which oversees the US shipping industry."
"The University of Maryland has reached a $3.5 million settlement with the family of Jordan McNair, the offensive lineman who died after suffering heatstroke during a team workout in 2018.  The details of the settlement became known Friday as part of the meeting agenda for the Maryland Board of Public Works, which is expected to approve the agreement on January 27.  “This has been a long and painful fight, but we will attempt to find closure even though this is a wound that will never, ever fully heal,” Jordan’s parents, Marty McNair and Tonya Wilson, said in a joint statement, according to ESPN."
"“Once Daniel became missing, we realized that, I think, the quick action wasn’t there quick enough,” his father, David Robinson, told CNN in September. “That caused me to have to do my own searching.”  David Robinson has said the amount of news coverage his Black son’s disappearance has received is “hurtful” when compared to that of Gabby Petito’s case – a White woman whose story become a national obsession for many when she went missing, spurring digital detectives to comb through her online trail to try to solve the case.  The story underscored the tens of thousands of missing persons stories that do not garner such intense interest. There were nearly 90,000 active missing person cases as of the end of 2020, according to the National Crime Information Center."
"The Kushner family hopes to lure investments from wealthy business owners in China with the promise of American visas.  Nicole Kushner Meyer, the sister of White House adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke at an event in Beijing on Saturday. She was marketing a Kushner-owned property in New Jersey -- invest in the development and get into the United States on a so-called EB-5 visa.  The EB-5 visa allows immigrants a path to a green card if they invest more than $500,000 in a project that creates jobs in the United States.  An ad for the event, held at a Ritz-Carlton hotel, said ""Invest $500,000 and immigrate to the United States."""
"By the time Zulema Green turned 12, her mother had been divorced three times.  Her husband, Cory Green, was 3 when his father abandoned his family.  As the Georgia couple recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary at an upscale restaurant overlooking Atlanta, their milestone represented a far more personal challenge for each of them: They didn't follow their parents' footsteps.  ""I figured I can get married,"" says Zulema Green, now a 31-year-old attorney. ""I can do it right.""  There are no precise statistics on the divorce rate in the U.S. because not all states report divorces. But among the states that did report, there were 3.4 divorces per 1,000 people in 2009, according to the National Center for Health Statistics."
"Every weekday night, Nur Aqilah Selamat packs leftovers for her “lunch” – to be taken when the rest of Singapore is fast asleep. “At 1.30am, I’ll be eating this,” she says, scooping rice and egg curry into a plastic container. “There’s nothing (else) for us at night because most of the shops are closed.”  And, with a quick adjustment to her headscarf and a swipe of coral lipstick, she heads out for the hour-long commute to work, with twins Nur Lutfiana and Nur Lutfiani, 9, running up to say a quick goodbye to their big sister at the door.  For about a year now, the 22-year-old has been an associate engineer at a semiconductor company, where her nine-hour shift starts at 10.45pm. She wanted these hours for they come with an extra allowance – meaning more money for her family."
"Malaysian actress Bella Astillah has filed for divorce from husband, Aliff Aziz, a Singaporean actor-singer.  Bella Astillah, 30, whose real name is Dayang Nabellah Awang Astillah, arrived at the Federal Territories’ Syariah Court in Jalan Duta around noon on Wednesday (Mar 13) after filing for divorce on Monday.   The actress told reporters present that the divorce is “the best way” for her.  ""As many of you already know, we previously reconciled and I think by us going on with our own paths, this might be the best for me and Aliff.  “He agreed to it earlier and as it is the month of Ramadan, I just want everything to go smoothly,” she said, as reported by several Malaysian news outlets.

"This is aligned with a shift in demand for dental services: patients now want products that are better, faster-acting and longer lasting. From safer bleaching agents to more resilient filling materials, there are plenty of ideas being thrown around.  But to turn such products into a reality, they need teeth for testing purposes — which the Tooth Tissue Bank could provide. “Singapore is a powerhouse for world-class research,” A/Prof Rosa stressed. “We already have the brainpower, so now if we just supply the resources to our people, the impact we can have globally is huge.”  Already, the Tooth Tissue Bank is fuelling such cutting-edge research. For instance, A/Prof Rosa has been working on using stem cells from extracted teeth to regenerate tooth pulp, the jelly-like centre of each tooth containing nerves, blood vessels and connective tissue."
"This was revealed in a study helmed by the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) Institute, Singapore (NCIS) and local thinktank Research For Impact Singapore (RFI). Sponsored by DBS Bank, the ongoing three-part study aims to examine the level of financial preparedness of Singapore residents to manage cancer.  Preliminarily findings by the research team shed light on how financial knowledge can affect an individual’s ability to navigate and cope with the challenges posed by cancer treatment and care.   “The financial impact of cancer is a real but poorly-understood and infrequently acknowledged concern in cancer care and survivorship,” said Dr Jen Wei Ying, clinical lead of the study and Consultant, Department of Haematology-Oncology, NCIS.  “Our data shows that cost concerns are prevalent, even in respondents who do not have a cancer diagnosis.”"
"For instance, compliant individuals were twice as likely as non-compliant individuals to have received a physician’s recommendation to get screened.  The family and social network of high-risk individuals are also key in influencing patients to complete the screening process, noted A/Prof Tan, who previously received a grant for his project on understanding and empowering the spouses of colorectal cancer patients.  The results of the studies have since been highlighted to the relevant government institutions, said A/Prof Tan. “Hopefully, our research can shed more light into issues pertaining to colorectal cancer screening and we can all work together to increase colorectal cancer screening rates in Singapore,” he added."
"A widely available cancer drug could potentially be used to treat COVID-19, found researchers from the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) in the United States.  The team found in pre-clinical trials that the drug, Topotecan, reduces the severity and death rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory genes in lung models.  This could have potential implications for COVID-19 treatment in humans, said NCIS.   Topotecan is an inexpensive and widely-used cancer drug that has been used in oncology for over 25 years. It is available all around the world, and has a well-understood safety profile."
"SINGAPORE - A Singapore of the not-so-distant future, where Covid-19 is endemic and herd immunity has been achieved through vaccination, will require adjustments in terms of health and urban policies, said experts.  Life for most people here will move to a new normal, where ""vaccine passports"" may be required not just for travel, but also to take part in daily activities.  Dr Woo Jun Jie from the Institute of Policy Studies at the National University of Singapore, who researches urban policy, said that once herd immunity is reached, a review of how closely packed Singapore is could be in order."
"It ranks as the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men, claiming between 300 to 500 lives in Singapore annually.  Despite its deadly nature, stomach cancer often evades early detection since its symptoms rarely manifest. Consequently, around two-thirds of stomach cancer patients receive a diagnosis only in the advanced stages, which significantly reduces their chances of recovery.  However, thanks to a recent genomic study by researchers from the National University Hospital (NUH), Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine) and Seoul National University, early detection of stomach cancer could soon become a reality."
"In regards to the gender-specific findings, the exact relationship has yet to be determined as further investigations into the data still need to take place. However, researchers proposed several possible reasons for these results: They theorised that screen-viewing time displaces physical activities in boys, resulting in more sedentary behaviour. Comparatively, girls were more likely to engage in non-screen-based sedentary behaviour, so the impact of the screen-viewing time may not be as pronounced on the latter.   “Boys might be naturally or socially encouraged to engage in physical activity when not watching screen devices. In contrast, girls might engage in other sedentary activities more frequently, as reported in a study with older children,” said Ms Natarajan Padmapriya, PhD student and lead author of the study, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore (SSHSPH).  Furthermore, Ms Padmapriya shared that “The GUSTO study previously reported sex differences in fat volumes among children. Hence, anatomical differences and the role of sex hormones in the metabolic profile could also explain the sex differences in these associations.”"
"As the spotlight on obesity grows, many researchers are trying to get to the bottom of this complex disease. And the key to understanding obesity, according to endocrinologist Asst Prof Khoo Chin Meng, is in humans themselves.   “Every human is different…they are created differently; they have different metabolic rates,” explained Asst Prof Khoo, who is also Head and Senior Consultant at the National University Hospital’s Department of Endocrinology, and Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine).   “So, if we want to understand obesity [within a person], we need to conduct phenotyping to understand their physiology first. But it’s not so simple,” he said."
"“With S. aureus, every one of us – at some time in our life – is sure to be infected. It’s impossible to escape,” said A/Prof Raymond Lin, Head and Senior Consultant, Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, NUH.   So the question that scientists must answer is whether S. singaporensis is likely to cause mild or severe disease – “whether it is more or less dangerous,” A/Prof Lin added.   For instance, the team’s assessment of the pathogen has so far been based on comparison with S. aureus. “But for all you know, S. singaporensis might carry its own set of peculiar virulence, we don’t know about that,” said Dr Jeanette Teo, Principal Scientific Officer, Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, NUH.

"According to a paper by researchers from the Cardiovascular- Metabolic Disease Translational Research Programme (CVMD TRP) at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine) and the Department of Cardiology at the National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS) under the National University Health System (NUHS), published in the Lancet Regional Health- Western Pacific, the number of heart attacks in Singapore is projected to rise nearly three-fold (194.4%) from 482 cases per 100,000 population in 2025, to 1,418 per 100,000 population in 2050.  “Year on year we see more people being admitted to the hospital for heart failure,” Prof Roger Foo, Director of the CVMD TRP at NUS Medicine and the Cardiovascular Research Institute under NUHCS, revealed."
"SINGAPORE: Big investors are zeroing in on age reversal research by biotechnology firms, with massive funding accelerating the pace of such studies.  Hong Kong-based Insilico Medicine is among the biotech firms benefitting from the interest.  Multiple investors have poured in more than US$400 million to support the firm since 2014. Among its biggest backers is Pavilion Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings.  Dr Alex Zhavoronkov, chief executive of Insilico Medicine, said Singapore is one of the major hubs for longevity research.  “Singapore is betting on future technologies and is attracting top scientists from all over the world,” he said."
"SINGAPORE: Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) and the National University of Singapore (NUS) have announced the setting up of a laboratory for biodiversity conservation and decarbonisation research.   RWS and NUS launched a 5-year applied research partnership on Wednesday (Jan 5) to set up a collaborative RWS-NUS Living Laboratory, they said in a joint media release.   RWS has committed S$10 million in funding to support the Living Laboratory and its research.

"SINGAPORE: A S$23.5 million programme to better understand the long-term impact of climate change on Singapore has been launched by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS).   The programme, titled the Climate Impact Science Research Programme, will focus on five key areas: Sea level rise; water resource and flood management; biodiversity and food security; human health and energy; and cross-cutting research to bridge science-policy translation.  Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced the launch in her speech on Tuesday (Jul 12) at the World Climate Research Programme’s Sea Level 2022 Conference.   She said the programme would ""bring together research in climate impact science""."
"SINGAPORE: Nanyang Technological University (NTU) announced on Thursday (Sep 2) that it has entered into an agreement with Hyundai Motor Group for a series of joint research projects focusing on ""advanced solutions"" for electric vehicle manufacturing.  The agreement was signed on Wednesday by Professor Lam Khin Yong, NTU’s senior vice president (research), and Hyundai Motor Group's senior vice president Hong Bum Jung.   The research will focus on “advanced solutions for the manufacturing of electric vehicles and to develop future mobility solutions”, NTU said in a news release.  “Focusing on Industry 4.0 technologies, these projects aim to develop solutions that can transform conventional car manufacturing facilities into state-of-the-art factories of the future,” it said."
"Anti-Muslim hate speech in India rose by 62 per cent in the second half of 2023 compared to the first six months of the year, a Washington-based research group said on Monday (Feb 26), adding the Israel-Gaza war played a key role in the last three months.  India Hate Lab documented 668 hate speech incidents targeting Muslims in 2023, 255 of which occurred in the first half of the year while 413 took place in the last six months of 2023, the research group said in a report released Monday.  About 75 per cent, or 498, of those incidents took place in states governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to the report. The states of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh accounted for the most hate speech."
"The children studied were part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort study, which began in 2008.  The Gusto study – a collaboration between A*STAR’s Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, National University Health System and National University of Singapore (NUS) – aims to investigate the effects of pregnancy and early childhood conditions on the health and development of both mothers and their children.  In the new study, researchers tracked the children across three time points – at ages two, five, and eight – with caregivers reporting on their child’s lifestyle behaviours including screen time, physical activity, and dietary intake, among others."
"While factors such as old age, obesity, smoking, and an unhealthy diet are often associated with diabetes risk, a recent study conducted by researchers from the National University Hospital (NUH) and the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), have found that weak muscle strength is linked to prevalence of diabetes among midlife women.  The study – which was conducted last year with 1,170 Chinese, Malay, and Indian women participants between the ages of 45 and 69 – found that midlife women with poor muscle strength were more than two times at risk of developing diabetes compared to those with normal muscle strength. This association was independent of the other known risk factors for diabetes."
"“(This includes) engaging international organisations and partners to deepen our understanding of evolving nuclear technologies and facilitate information sharing.”  These organisations include the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency that promotes the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies; the UK Atomic Energy Authority, which researches fusion energy; and the Max Planck Institute in Germany.  The German institute houses the futuristic Wendelstein-7X – the world’s largest stellarator, an experimental reactor for nuclear fusion reactions.  The EMA spokesman added that Singapore is also working with regional neighbours through Asean platforms to build the region’s capabilities in nuclear safety and emergency preparedness and response."
"“One of the strengths of our study is the diversity of its participants as we have involved women of multiple ethnicities from the general population across three countries, which means that the outcomes have wide relevance to women planning for pregnancy,” said A/Prof Chan. “Additionally, the study included blinded intervention and control groups, so bias is minimised.”  The primary outcome paper was published in the journal Diabetes Care earlier this year. The study was developed and led by investigators of the multi-national EpiGen Academic Research Consortium – which counts among its members NUH as well as the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, A*STAR – in collaboration with Nestlé Research.

"“Over the last seven years, we’ve been trying to eat spaghetti with a spoon,” said Asst Prof Pipin, who leads the newly-formed Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT), which aims to improve the treatment of PE in Singapore. He explained that given the lack of options, the team initially resorted to using tools used to treat other conditions to tackle the clots.  However, due to the vast differences in organ anatomy – the artery of a heart, for instance, is about 4mm in diameter, while the artery of a lung is ten times as wide – this method was used only as a last resort.

"According to two studies conducted in 2023 by the Integrated Women’s Health Programme (IWHP) at the National University Hospital (NUH) and the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine), aches and pains in the muscles and joints rank as the top complaint among menopausal women in Singapore. These studies found that this issue affects between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of women in the country.  The problem? Most doctors, both in Singapore and around the world, do not recognise joint pain as a symptom of menopause.  ""Menopausal joint pain – also known as arthralgia – is a condition that clinicians globally are not well aware of,” highlighted Professor Yong Eu Leong, Emeritus Consultant at NUH's Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

"The study, led by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases academic journal on Sep 25, is the first and largest to examine the risk of long COVID in a highly vaccinated, multi-ethnic Southeast Asian population, said NTU in a news release on Oct 9.   The study found that 912 out of 106,012 patients - all unvaccinated - who had recovered from COVID-19 reported ""lingering after-effects"" consistent with long COVID syndromes, which may include fatigue, shortness of breath, memory problems, and heart complications such as cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and thrombosis.  The study was carried out by researchers from the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), the Ministry of Health, Singapore General Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases."
"The distances between Mars and Earth are great, and there are limited numbers of favourable launch opportunities. If a permanent Martian settlement of any scale is to be established and maintained, it seems likely that women will need to get pregnant and give birth beyond Mother Earth.  Moreover, if human history is any guide, it is reasonable to conclude that the long-term cohabitation of men and women on Mars will inevitably result in pregnancies.  In early preparation for this, researchers at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine have started a joint programme with local space organisation, Singapore Space and Technology Ltd to study how radiation and microgravity will affect the human reproductive system."
"SINGAPORE: Chatbots can provide some comfort to people with mental health issues, but they fall short when it comes to detecting suicidal tendencies or offering appropriate help in crisis situations, researchers have found.   A study of nine mental health chatbots by the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) showed that they empathise with users in conversations, but were unable to understand users who express suicidal tendencies or offer personalised advice.   Chatbots, or computer programmes that simulate human conversations, are increasingly used in healthcare. They are used to manage mental health conditions or support general well-being.

"SINGAPORE: One in five caregivers in Singapore find meaning in looking after their loved ones, despite facing a high caregiving burden, according to a Duke-NUS Medical School study.  As Singapore faces an ageing population, supporting caregivers has become vital.   The wide-ranging study hopes to better support caregivers by understanding their different needs, which can help the sector to come up with more targeted assistance.   FINDING PURPOSE IN CAREGIVING  Findings on the extent of burdens and benefits of caregiving were shared on Wednesday (Mar 13) during a family caregiver symposium.   The event was organised by the Duke-NUS Medical School’s Centre for Ageing Research and Education (CARE) and Tsao Foundation, an organisation working with ageing issues."
"One of Nagoya University’s brightest stars is Professor Hiroshi Amano.  He was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 2014 for inventing the light-emitting diode (LED), a semiconductor device which enables bright and energy-saving white light sources.  LED lighting products, which are now commonly used worldwide, produce light up to 90 per cent more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs.  With about one-fourth of world electricity consumption used for lighting purposes, the highly energy-efficient LED contributes to enormous savings in energy as countries confront a climate crisis.  Prof Amano shared the award with his mentor Isamu Akasaki and Japanese-born American Shuji Nakamura."
"Taking the sting out of dengue, in a manner of speaking, is what Associate Professor Paul MacAry has set out to do. And he is “getting close”, 10 years after his first breakthrough.  In 2012, he and his team from the Immunology Translational Research Programme at the National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine) isolated a human antibody after screening “literally hundreds of millions” of antibodies derived from individuals who had recovered from dengue serotype 1, he recounted.  These were patients from the National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  “We saw this outlier, this antibody that appeared to kill the virus within a few hours, and it did it at concentrations that were much lower than any of the other antibodies we isolated,” said MacAry, who is also the director of the NUS’ Life Sciences Institute."
"A study by the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) last year found that one in 10 recovered patients in Singapore had persistent symptoms even after six months. But since the study was conducted before vaccines were widely available and the Delta variant reached our shores, these numbers will likely change over time.  One major challenge is that there is no standard definition and diagnostic test for long COVID. Most medical providers consider a patient to have long COVID when they’re still unwell three months after their initial infection.  Medical staff employ a wide variety of responses to long COVID, including multiple diagnostic studies and best-guess treatments of uncertain effectiveness and cost. Treatments depend on symptoms, and may include respiratory therapy, physical therapy, medication and counselling."
"In Singapore, stomach cancer – or gastric cancer – ranks fourth for men and fifth for women in cancer-related deaths, claiming around 500 lives annually.  Such cancers are typically diagnosed through an endoscopy, where a doctor uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a miniature camera attached to the end) to examine the stomach. If necessary, the doctor can retrieve a small tissue sample (biopsy) using the device.  While endoscopy is typically performed for diagnostic purposes, a robot-assisted operating system can effectively remove gastro-intestinal tumours endoscopically without the need for surgical incisions too. Called the EndoMaster, it was co-invented by clinician innovator Prof Lawrence Ho from the National University Hospital Hospital (NUH)."
"At NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine), A/Prof Justin Chu and his team have made headway in developing a rapid test for detecting HFMD using miRNA in saliva. The main objective for the test is to detect HFMD before symptoms show up – this allows children carrying the virus to be identified early and isolated, making it easier to break the chain of transmission.  In a study, the team was able to accurately distinguish HFMD patients from healthy persons in 90% of test cases in Singapore, and 80% in Taiwan.  The hope for A/Prof Chu and his team is simple – to have such HFMD test kits be commonplace in pre-schools and childcare centres in the near future, so that patients who may be carrying the disease but are asymptomatic can be easily identified."
"The proliferation of AI has similarly occurred on the medical front – in recent years, researchers and doctors have stepped up their efforts to explore the applications of AI technology across the medical field.  One key area of AI in medicine is oncology. According to the Ministry of Health, cancer has been the leading cause of death among Singaporeans for three consecutive years, from 2018 to 2020. Therefore, it is crucial for Singapore healthcare to harness the power of AI to improve oncology care.  To that end, researchers and medical professionals at National University Health System (NUHS) have been working hand in hand to develop AI technology that can help the department of oncology provide quality care for their patients."
"Shigeichi Negishi, the entrepreneur who invented the world’s first karaoke machine, has died aged 100.  Negishi, whose 1967 “Sparko Box” prototype is among several devices credited with ushering in Japan’s karaoke craze, died from natural causes in January. His death, which was made public last week, was confirmed to CNN by Shiro Kataoka, managing director of the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.  Born in 1923, Negishi founded and ran a company that assembled car stereos for automobile manufacturers in northern Tokyo. A regular listener to a singalong radio show broadcast in Japan at the time, he hooked a spare tape deck up to a microphone and mixing circuit so he could hear himself singing over music."
"This concept of robotic telesurgery was put to the test on 9 to 11 October 2023 by clinician-scientists from the National University Hospital (NUH) and the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine).  Seated in the surgeon console at the Advanced Surgery Training Centre in NUH, both Prof Jimmy So and Asst. Prof Kim Guowei – who are from the department of surgery at NUS Medicine – remotely controlled a robotic operation unit located over 5,000km away at Fujita Health University (FHU) in Japan.  With a dedicated international fibre-optic network supporting the operation, the two surgeons were able to successfully perform three gastrectomies (stomach cancer surgery) on a high-precision model stomach at FHU."
"Huawei Technologies and China's top chipmaker SMIC have built an advanced 7-nanometre processor to power its latest smartphone, according to a teardown report by analysis firm TechInsights.  Huawei's Mate 60 Pro is powered by a new Kirin 9000s chip that was made in China by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), TechInsights said in the report shared with Reuters on Monday.  Huawei started selling its Mate 60 Pro phone last week. The specifications provided advertised its ability to make satellite calls, but offered no information on the power of the chipset inside.  The processor is the first to utilise SMIC's most advanced 7nm technology and suggests the Chinese government is making some headway in attempts to build a domestic chip ecosystem, the research firm said."
"SAN FRANCISCO, California: Huawei Technologies' breakthrough in making an advanced chip underscores China's determination and capacity for fighting back against United States sanctions, but the efforts are likely very costly and could prompt Washington to tighten curbs, analysts said.  Huawei unexpectedly unveiled the latest Mate 60 Pro smartphone last week during US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's visit to China, as the government readies a new US$40 billion investment fund to bolster its developing chip sector.   The Mate 60 Pro is powered by its proprietary chip Kirin 9000s and manufactured by the country's top contract chipmaker SMIC using an advanced 7 nanometre (nm) technology, according to a teardown by Ottawa-headquartered TechInsights."
"SINGAPORE – A new $10 million chemical engineering lab in Jurong will study ways to recycle and produce batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), a global priority as the first wave of EVs are nearing obsolescence.  The Innovation Technology Hub (InTecH) at the Jurong Innovation District marks Swiss chemical engineering company Sulzer’s first research and development centre in Asia.  It features a range of chemical separation equipment, including a higher-yield fractional distillation tower – said to be the tallest research tower among pilot plants in Asia – to recycle all sorts of chemicals, plastics and lubricant oils.  The research and development facility, which was launched on March 5, allows clients to test new methods of recycling chemicals before they are deployed at scale, said Sulzer chief executive and executive president Suzanne Thoma."
"LAS VEGAS – If you often groan amid Singapore’s sweltering temperatures, a start-up in the Republic has built special watches that could come in handy, with the aim to help users beat the heat.  Touted as a “personal air-conditioner” on the wrist, Silent Cicada’s line of watches, which start at $200, use an advanced cooling plate placed against the wrist to reduce blood flow temperature.  The wrist has a higher concentration of veins, which causes the area to be more sensitive to users, influencing their perceived temperature, Silent Cicada founder Jing Che said.  The company is among those showcasing tech innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024 to investors, distributors and industry players in Las Vegas from Jan 9 to 12."

Advanced tracking device  Smart trackers are handy, but what happens if you lose an item that the tracker is attached to in a high-rise building?   This is the problem that location intelligence developer Tack – another Singapore-based start-up showcasing its innovation at CES – aims to solve with its GPS tracker, which can pinpoint its location on a map as well as elevation, allowing the user to locate roughly where in a building it could be.   The dongle requires a SIM card and can track its location across more than 120 countries. "
"SINGAPORE - Keeping public toilets clean has been a long-time bane for cleaners here. But they will soon receive a helping hand to scrub, mop and dry toilets from a new colleague: a toilet-cleaning robot.  The autonomous robot moves around the loo seeking out stains and areas to clean, guided by sensors that give it a 3D view of its surroundings.  When there is a job to do, its swivelling arm picks up implements from a utility rack, like brushes and a steam spray attachment to blast stubborn stains and bacteria away.  Dubbed the Abluo – Latin for “cleanse” – the robot is intended to halve the time that human cleaners typically spend cleaning toilets so that they can focus on other tasks, said Mr Tuan Dung Nguyen, co-founder of HiveBotics, the cleaning automation start-up behind the robot."
"TTSH is the first healthcare institution in Singapore to introduce such an automated system that processes bacteria which can cause infections.  The lab has become more productive despite increasing workload, said Dr De Partha Pratim, senior consultant in the hospital’s Department of Laboratory Medicine.   “Overall, the system has produced savings in time (and) effort, and that means we can get results out faster, which enables the system as a whole to function more quickly. And we are less of a bottleneck for the rest of the hospital.”  “With a rising workload, which goes up every year by about 4 or 5 per cent, we haven't had to employ new staff to do the work. The automation has absorbed that workload while still keeping the turnaround time,” he added."
"Mr Tan and Mr Berber – whose paths converged in 2022 at food accelerator Entrepreneur First – chose to develop an alternative coffee as it is a crop that is not only threatened by climate change, but also contributing significantly to it.   “This is a vicious, negative circle that we want to stop, by taking coffee beans out of the equation,” says Mr Berber, who has been based in Singapore since moving here in 2022 to finish his entrepreneurship MBA at NUS Business School.   The co-founders have a long-term goal that goes beyond coffee. They hope to address other problem crops threatened by climate change – such as vanilla, cacao and hazelnuts – using the same fermentation technology. "
"CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan, who chairs the innovation centre’s governing board, said there is technology available, but it is costly and complex to deploy, hence a new model of cooperation is required.  For a start, the centre has secured $140 million in funding from Singapore’s National Research Foundation (NRF) to work on next-generation air navigation services over a five-year period.  For instance, it is looking to set up a regional experimentation platform that will allow users to share weather data and flight paths.  CAAS said it is looking at similar funding arrangements for the centre’s three other focus areas."
"Healthcare and fitness uses in smartwatches in recent times have catapulted the popularity of these devices. They are an extension of the mobile phone and monitor a plethora of readings, from a user’s heart rate to his location and even how well he sleeps.  Wearables are appealing because they offer personalised readings of the user’s health, said Professor Lim Chwee Teck from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Institute for Health Innovation and Technology.  He is one of many experts at the university who are developing wearable-related technology, including stretchy electrical circuits that patch themselves when torn by oozing out liquid metal, and sensors that track movement during rehabilitation, which will allow users to monitor their own progress."
"Scientists in Singapore have developed an electricity-conducting circuit that stretches up to 22 times its original length and heals itself when it tears, paving the way for more durable and comfortable healthcare and monitoring equipment that can be mounted on or wrapped around a patient’s body.  Developed by the National University of Singapore (NUS), the breakthrough aims to break free from the rigid designs of circuits that power smart devices today.  These circuits are usually made of conductive metals that are stiff or prone to damage.  Researchers from NUS developed a material called Bilayer Liquid-Solid Conductor that can stretch up to 22 times its original length without a significant drop in electrical conductivity, said Professor Lim Chwee Teck, director of the Institute for Health Innovation and Technology at NUS and head of the research team."
"Singapore AI solutions company Mind PointEye has recently set up an office in Yangzhou, about two hours from Shanghai by high-speed rail.  The company was recently involved in developing smart security robots that will be rolled out in Singapore later in May, patrolling several indoor and outdoor venues.   Founder Huang Guangbin said it was Yangzhou’s accessibility and historic culture that drew him to the city.   “Often in our field, you need creativity for problem-solving, and a nice environment promotes that,” Professor Huang said.    “Furthermore, if home prices are affordable, my younger staff will be able to buy their homes quickly, not be distracted about other cost of living problems, and focus their attention on research. It’s a win-win solution.”"
"Singapore biotech start-up BioSyngen, which is developing cancer treatments in China, found Guangzhou Knowledge City to be a good base from which to launch its venture in China. A cluster of top hospitals within a small radius means it can conduct clinical trials more quickly, with access to more patients.  Unlike Singrow, it faces many competitors in the cell therapy space in China. Data by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States shows that of the nearly 900 clinical trials that are going on worldwide, more than half are in China, said BioSyngen’s chief business officer Isaac Chow."
"Nanyang Technological University (NTU) mechanical engineering student Carlo Charles, 21, is among the innovators in the running to develop electronics powered by paper batteries that could serve as a safe and sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries.  His work has received acclaim, winning the grand prize in the Youth Action Challenge organised by the National Youth Council in February.  An avid inventor since childhood, the Singaporean is one of 40 innovators and start-ups recognised on Thursday at the launch of a new initiative by NTU to support entrepreneurs.  Concerns have grown over lithium-ion batteries, which are short in supply amid an electrical energy boom and which contribute to toxic waste."
"The researcher lost her eyesight at 14 as a result of an accident in elementary school. After graduating from university, she joined computer maker IBM Japan’s research and development division in Tokyo in 1985.  According to Dr Asakawa, she started using computers to help overcome challenges in finding information herself as a visually impaired person.  At IBM Research Tokyo, she developed a Japanese digital Braille system and a voice-enabled Internet browser.  In 2009, she was appointed IBM fellow, the highest position for IBM engineers, and in 2014, she went to an American university as an IBM distinguished service professor, which involved more opportunities for international travel."
"LexBuild is a home-grown company founded in 2000 by Singaporean Charles Tan, 51, as a bus and coach body builder. Today, the company offers a range of engineering services and solutions across buses, trains and special-purpose vehicles.  Its prototype, called the LexSwitch electric vehicle (EV) bus, is big on innovation. Unlike other electric buses where the batteries are concentrated in one area, the prototype stores its batteries across its roof, undercarriage and rear compartment.  The balanced weight distribution reduces uneven wear and tear on the vehicle’s components, including its tires, brakes and suspension system.  It also breaks new ground in other ways: It uses light and durable honeycomb composite materials instead of conventional plywood for its floorboard, and ultralight aerogel instead of foam for insulation. This decreases its weight and energy consumption, and maintenance costs and needs"
"The pre-schooler came up with a device to assist visually impaired people in their day-to-day activities. It won first prize in the kindergarten category in a competition.  Her invention, Renee’s Necklace for the Blind, can be worn around the neck, giving voice directions through its GPS function, and alerting its user via sensors when there is danger.  Renee was among more than 100 young inventors who showcased their ideas to solve real-world issues at the Pratt & Whitney Singapore Invention Convention held at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) from Nov 22 to 23.  The competition, which was jointly organised by Stemie Advantages and TP, and held in tandem with the convention, showcased the ingenuity of 116 students aged five to 19 from Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. They came from more than 15 schools and submitted 80 inventions."
"The second prize went to Team X-3 from Temasek Polytechnic, which developed a mobile app that connects gig economy workers such as delivery riders and sales staff with retail brands to deal with manpower shortage.  The third prize winner, Team Biodynamic from NTU, NUS and the Singapore Institute of Technology, partnered FairPrice to devise a system using reusable crates instead of plastic bags to pack online delivery orders of grocery items to reduce packaging waste.  Team Commersseurs' Mr Chua said his group plan to kick off their project soon by acquiring seed funding from private investors and see it through to execution."
"High amounts of moisture in the air, or humidity, on tropical islands such as Singapore make it harder for sweat to evaporate, thus making temperatures feel hotter than they are.  Prof Tan's concern about heat stress grew as the Covid-19 pandemic hit and he realised that healthcare workers endured a felt temperature of about 64 deg C when donning personal protective equipment at room temperature.  Citing a 2020 study, he noted that such suits often caused these workers to experience thermal strain, leading to exhaustion and dizziness.  So he led a team of NUS researchers to develop a composite film that lowers felt temperatures to 40 deg C in protective suits by enhancing sweat evaporation."
"Japan will work to strengthen its defence and diplomatic capabilities to maintain peace, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio said on Saturday (Mar 23), according to public broadcaster NHK, adding that military buildups around the country have been growing.  Japan is a close ally with the United States and has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, supporting Kyiv financially and joining international sanctions on Moscow.  Military buildup, including nuclear and missile development, has been accelerating in areas surrounding Japan and attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force are growing,"" Kishida told a graduation ceremony at the National Defence Academy in Yokosuka near Tokyo, according to NHK."""
"A sign of thawing relations, as China's top diplomat Wang Yi met his Australian counterpart Penny Wong and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in a rare diplomatic visit to the country. China said Mr Wang's trip -- his first in seven years -- was productive. Both countries claimed to have stabilised long-strained relations after their talks in Canberra. Relations unravelled over the past few years, after Australia called for an international investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both countries would later impose tit-for-tat restrictions on each other's exports."
"Singapore and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday (Mar 21) on artificial intelligence (AI) cooperation, signalling both countries' intent to accelerate cross-border collaboration in the area.   Singapore’s Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who is in Israel on an official visit, signed the MOU with Israel Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Orit Farkash-Hacohen.  The MOU on cooperation in AI between Singapore’s Smart Nation and Digital Government Office and Israel’s Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology will support the development and deployment of AI for “collective benefit”, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a press statement."
"China offered to support long-time strategic partner Hungary on public security issues, going beyond trade and investment relations, during a rare meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Orban, just as NATO struggles to expand its network in Europe.  China hopes to deepen law enforcement and security ties with Hungary as the two mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations, Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong told Orban last week, the official Xinhua news agency said.  During a visit to Budapest, Wang said he hoped such efforts would be a new highlight of bilateral relations"" in areas such as combating terrorism and transnational crimes."""
"Solomon Islands is expected to next week call a national election for April, with China security ties emerging as a key issue as political parties launch campaigns in the Pacific Islands nation.  Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China soon after the 2019 election that brought him to power, later forging a security pact with Beijing that alarmed Washington and Canberra, and set off a race for influence in the strategically located Pacific Islands.  A prominent opposition party figure, the United Party's Peter Kenilorea, said he wanted the China security pact reviewed, and would also seek to re-establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the Solomon Star newspaper reported on Wednesday (Feb 14)."
"Guatemala is considering reaching out to develop formal trade ties with China, the Central American country's foreign minister told Reuters on Monday (Feb 5), although it plans to maintain its existing relations with Taiwan.  The Central American country is one of a handful of Taiwan's remaining allies, as countries increasingly side with the world's second largest economy China, which claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its territory.  We are going to continue working with Taiwan at the levels we have been doing,"" Foreign Minister Carlos Ramiro Martinez said in an interview. ""But the president has pointed out that we cannot ignore the weight and power China represents.""  President Bernardo Arevalo assumed office in mid-January amid a fraught transition process, vowing to put an end to corruption and also establish relations with China."""
"Singapore's strong and deep"" relations with China have not been affected, said Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Monday (Feb 5), after China made ""solemn demarches"" to Singapore over its congratulations to Taiwan's William Lai Ching-te.  A demarche is a diplomatic statement.  In a written answer to a parliamentary question by MP Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) about the relationship between the two countries, Dr Balakrishnan said: ""Singapore was approached by the Chinese, and we reiterated our longstanding approach and 'One China' policy.  ""Our strong and deep relations with China have not been affected, and our engagements with China have proceeded apace."""""
"Papua New Guinea is in early talks with China on a potential security and policing deal, Foreign Minister Justin Tkachenko told Reuters, weeks after deadly riots in the South Pacific nation's capital.  Amid jostling between Washington and Beijing for influence in the Pacific, the biggest Pacific Islands nation, Papua New Guinea, has previously said Australia and the United States are its security partners, while China is an important economic partner.  China approached Papua New Guinea in September with an offer to assist its police force with training, equipment and surveillance technology, Tkachenko said in an interview with Reuters on Monday (Jan 29). Talks continued last week."
"SHARING A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP  Mr Tharman praised the warmth and hospitality he received during the state visit to Brunei, adding that both countries also exchanged views on many matters.   He said Singapore and Brunei share “a special relationship” that rests not just on strategic considerations or common strategic interests, but one that “has always rested on personal relationships”.   This started with former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and the late Seri Begawan Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien, father of the current Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, and the relationship “has been renewed ever since by successive leaders in Singapore”, he added.   “So the personal relationships really matter. Because at the end of the day, it's a relationship of trust.”"
"Just two days after a Taiwanese election with its ruling party securing the presidency, the Pacific island of Nauru said it was cutting formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, in favour of establishing relations with Beijing.   What exactly happened? On Monday (Jan 15), Nauru’s President David Adeang announced in a national address his country’s decision to end its decades-long ties with Taiwan to recognise China.  The Nauru government also said in a statement that the move was in the “best interests” of the island nation and its people.  It added that Nauru would be moving to follow the ""one China principle"" and was seeking a resumption of full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China – referring to China’s official name.

"Singapore and Laos will strengthen cooperation in various areas including sustainability and environmental protection as well as urban planning and logistics, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (Sep 28).   He was delivering a toast speech at an official lunch held in honour of his Laotian counterpart Mr Phankham Viphavanh, who is in Singapore on an official visit.  The Laos prime minister's visit comes ahead of a key milestone in 2024, which will mark the 50th anniversary of Singapore and Laos diplomatic ties.   Mr Lee shared that the two countries have signed an agreement on energy cooperation and have also renewed an existing agreement on environmental protection, climate change, and water resource management."
"Singapore's relationship with Malaysia should not be complicated by the countries' differing diplomatic relations with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Monday (Oct 30).  ""I don't think they should affect our bilateral relations. I think we have each expressed our views on what is happening in the Middle East,"" he said during a joint press conference with Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after the 10th leaders' retreat in Singapore.  Mr Lee was responding to a question about how Singapore and Malaysia will ensure that their approaches and ground sentiments to the Middle East conflict do not have a ""spillover effect"" on bilateral relations."
"Prabowo will also visit Japan on Apr 2 to 3, where he is set to meet Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and other officials, Japan's chief Cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Monday.  Japan and Indonesia are comprehensive strategic partners sharing fundamental principles and values, and it is hoped Prabowo's visit will bolster close bilateral cooperation in a wide range of areas, Hayashi told a regular press conference.  In 2021, Prabowo and Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi signed a deal to facilitate defence equipment transfers in a meeting with their Japanese counterparts, as Japan seeks to expand military and economic cooperation with Southeast Asian nations to counter China.  Japan and Indonesia in December reached another deal to remove more trade barriers."
"A WARY INDIA  Russia enjoys a “privileged strategic partnership” with India. The relationship has strong historical roots, dating back to non-aligned India’s shared anti-colonial sentiment with the Soviet Union. India has carefully avoided taking sides in the Russia-Ukraine war.  Russia has long been New Delhi’s main arms supplier. While India’s weapons sources are becoming more diverse, it still needs Russian logistical support to maintain its existing weapons inventory.  India is a major oil importer, and rapid economic growth is driving increased demand. In the past year, India has massively increased purchases of cheap Russian oil.  India values close, stable relations with Russia as a strategic hedge against China, its main rival. The more so now, as India views warily Moscow’s closer relationship with Beijing, prompting New Delhi in turn to boost ties with the United States, Japan and Australia."

"China's government on Wednesday (Apr 10) labelled as dangerous"" comments by a senior US diplomat that the AUKUS submarine project between Australia, Britain and the United States could help deter any Chinese move against Taiwan.  The project, finalised by the three countries last year, involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered attack submarines as part of the allies' efforts to push back against China's growing power in the Indo-Pacific region.  Speaking last week, the US State Department's number two diplomat, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, said the new submarine capabilities would enhance peace and stability, including in the strait that separates China and Taiwan."
"Vietnam and Japan on Monday (Nov 27) officially upgraded their relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership"" during a visit by Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong to Tokyo.  The move underlined Vietnam's increasingly strategic role as an important link in global supply chains amid trade tension between China and the West, which is helping to bring foreign investment to the Southeast Asian country as some companies relocate operations from China.  ""This is an important event, opening a new chapter in the Vietnam-Japan relations,"" Thuong said in a speech broadcast on national television.  The elevation of ties with Japan followed Vietnam's historic upgrade of relations with the United States in September, when the former foes signed multiple cooperation agreements, including on semiconductors and critical minerals."""
"More joint patrols can be expected in the South China Sea after drills by the United States, Australia, the Philippines and Japan last weekend, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday (Apr 9), ahead of US summits this week with Japanese and Philippine leaders.  Warships from the four nations staged the exercises on Sunday following stepped-up Chinese pressure on the Philippines in the disputed strategic waterway.  US President Joe Biden hosts Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Washington on Wednesday. Both leaders as well as Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos will meet on Thursday for talks that will include ways to push back against China."
"Pakistan and Iran have restored diplomatic ties according to the caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar's office.  It comes after both countries exchanged drone and missile strikes on militant bases on each other's territory.  As a result of the tit-for-tat attacks Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals.  Both ambassadors are now expected to return to their posts following talks.  Iran said Thursday's strikes killed nine people in a border village on its territory, including four children. Pakistan said an Iranian attack on Tuesday killed two children.  There has been no immediate comment from Iran on the talks."
"After weeks of speculation it's finally been announced - tiny little Singapore will host the historic Trump-Kim Jong-un summit.  The ""little red dot"" beat the DMZ, Mongolia and even Beijing as a place for the meeting to be held.  President Trump has shown that you don't need China - North Korea's most important trading partner - to talk to Pyongyang.  Still, it does beg the question. Besides a great airport and some neatly manicured gardens, why Singapore?  North Korea feels comfortable here There aren't many countries North Korea has done business with. Singapore is high on the list, coming in at number eight in 2016, but that only made up 0.2% of the North's trade."
"Chad and Israel have renewed diplomatic ties in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as ""a partnership... to forge a prosperous and secure future for our countries"".  His comments came during a brief visit to Chad where he was welcomed by President Idriss Deby.  In recent years, Israel has made a big effort to improve diplomatic relations with several African countries.  Chad, which has a majority Muslim population, cut ties in 1972.  Mr Netanyahu's visit reciprocates President Deby's trip to Israel last November, the first by a Chadian leader.  In addition to renewing diplomatic ties the two leaders signed several agreements, Mr Deby told a joint press conference, but did not say what those deals were."
"The Vatican and Malaysia have agreed to establish diplomatic ties, following a meeting between Pope Benedict XVI and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.  The move comes after years of talks between the Catholic Church and the government of majority-Muslim Malaysia.  Mr Najib's visit was said to have been intended to reassure Christians in his country, who have long complained of discrimination.  Ethnic and religious tensions have risen ahead of expected national polls.  On Monday Mr Najib met the Pope at his summer home near Rome.  In a statement, the Vatican said that during their ""cordial conversations, the positive developments in bilateral relations were discussed and an agreement was reached to establish diplomatic relations between Malaysia and the Holy See""."
"Saudi Arabia and Thailand have ended a 30-year row over a scandal involving stolen jewels and a string of murders.  The resumption of full diplomatic ties came during a visit to Riyadh by Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha.  A Thai cleaner working for a Saudi prince took the gems in 1989. A rare 50 carat blue diamond was never recovered.  Three Saudi diplomats were shot dead in Bangkok following the theft. Several top Thai policemen were implicated in the affair but never convicted.  The deal opens the way for Thais once again to find employment in Saudi Arabia, which says it needs millions of overseas workers."
"Qatar has restored full diplomatic relations with Iran in defiance of four other Arab nations who have demanded it curb ties with the Islamic Republic.  The emirate recalled its ambassador in 2016 when Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran were attacked after Saudi Arabia executed a leading Shia Muslim cleric.  But Qatar now wants to strengthen bilateral relations ""in all fields"".  Iran has helped Qatar cope with the trade and travel restrictions imposed by its powerful neighbours since June.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain accused Qatar of supporting terrorist groups across the region and of being too close to Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field. The emirate has strenuously denied the allegations."
"Thailand says it will resume diplomatic ties with Cambodia after Phnom Penh announced the resignation of ousted Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra as its economic advisor.  The two countries recalled their ambassadors in November 2009 amid a row over the controversial appointment.  The Thai military removed Mr Thaksin in a coup in 2006, and he has since been jailed in absentia for corruption.  Authorities say he was behind anti-government protests earlier this year.  Mr Thaksin denies any role in the protests, which paralysed the Thai capital for more than two months and left 91 people dead.  ""They have announced that they do not have any more ties with Thaksin so our condition to hold back a diplomat has ended,"" Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya told Reuters news agency."
"Russian leader Vladimir Putin was given the red carpet treatment at a global summit in Beijing, as China and Russia deepen their solidarity.  Hosted by China's President Xi Jinping, the meeting celebrated 10 years of his signature foreign and economic policy, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  Mr Putin was the guest of honour among leaders and officials from more than 130 countries.  He has rarely left his country since invading Ukraine in February last year.  Not only is he facing increasing diplomatic isolation, he has also been issued an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Ukraine."
"That stability, which has been guaranteed for decades by a state tightly controlled by the Communist Party, now looks less certain, although analysts agree that the current leadership changes will not impact the country's key policies, including its bamboo diplomacy"" aimed at keeping good relations with the United States and China at the same time.  Behind the latest reshuffle is the long-lasting ""blazing furnace"" anti-graft campaign that party chief Nguyen Phu Trong launched back in 2016.  It is aimed at eradicating corruption so widespread that in some provinces up to 90 per cent of applicants for land certificates paid a bribe, according to a report published in March 2023 by the UN Development Programme and other organisations."""
"Israel and Bahrain have formally established diplomatic relations.  The deal - brokered by the US - was signed in the Bahrain capital, Manama, on Sunday.  For decades, most Arab states have boycotted Israel, insisting they would only establish ties after the Palestinian dispute was settled.  Bahrain is now the fourth Arab country in the MIddle East - after the UAE, Egypt and Jordan - to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948.  Palestinians have condemned the diplomatic moves as a ""stab in the back"".  At a ceremony in Manama on Sunday evening, Bahraini and Israeli officials signed a ""joint communiqué"" establishing full diplomatic relations. The two countries are now expected to open embassies."
"Dahal led a decade-long insurgency from 1996 which caused 17,000 deaths before he joined mainstream politics under the 2006 peace deal overseen by the United Nations.  He is serving a third time as prime minister but did not complete the full five-year term during his previous stints.  Nepal has had 13 governments since it abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008 and became a republic.  Instability has hampered growth of the US$40 billion economy and thousands of young Nepalis are heading abroad - mainly to the Middle East, South Korea and Malaysia - for work.  Nepal has extensive social and economic ties with India, a key donor. China is also pouring in aid and investment in infrastructure to woo Kathmandu as an ally."
"The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said that its delegation visited South Korea in December to discuss the defence cost-sharing deal and would work with Seoul to prepare for talks on the next agreement.  Former President Donald Trump, favoured to be the Republican candidate in the election, had accused South Korea, a key Asian ally, of free-riding"" on US military might, called for stopping what he called ""expensive"" war games, and demanded that Seoul pay as much as US$5 billion a year for the US deployment.  If Trump is elected, South Korea will work with his government, but the alliance will remain unchanged in part because of solid support from the US Congress for greater bilateral cooperation and a trilateral partnership involving Japan, the official said."""
"We are launching this Cyprus maritime corridor together, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates and the United States,"" she said after visiting facilities in Larnaca, Cyprus.  ""We are now very close to opening this corridor, hopefully this Saturday-Sunday and I'm very glad to see an initial pilot will be launched today.""  US officials say building the pier described by Biden could take weeks. Meanwhile, hospitals in northern Gaza are already reporting children dying of malnutrition. The UN says opening up more land routes should remain the priority.  ""No US boots will be on the ground,"" said Biden, who did not indicate where the planned pier might be located. Most of Gaza's coast is beach and larger ships would be unable to approach it without dredging."""
"Algeria, which cut diplomatic ties with its North African neighbour two years ago, said it could send 80 specialised rescue workers from its civil protection force.  There have also been offers from the US, Tunisia, Turkey and Taiwan among others.  But the decision over what assistance to welcome has got caught up in questions of sovereignty and geopolitics.  There are strained relations between France and Morocco, for instance, partly as a result of moves by French President Emmanuel Macron to get closer to Algeria.  But the French authorities have tried to play down any idea that they had been snubbed.  ""This is a misplaced controversy,"" Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying."
"What is interesting are the events prior to that. Malaysia established diplomatic ties with North Korea on 2 July 1973, well ahead of the establishment of relations with China in May 1974.  It remains unclear exactly why Malaysia would go down such a path. The main reason could have been a desire to embrace neutrality as Malaysia's new strategic foreign policy direction.  And indeed Malaysia's pole position with the North allowed it to play a friendly third nation role in facilitating secret talks as well as open negotiations between the US, South Korea and North Korea throughout the nuclear talks in the 2000s."
"Angering China and Somalia Both are unrecognised internationally and both have larger neighbours - Somalia and China - which insist they are part of their territories.  Somaliland and Taiwan established diplomatic relations last year to the fury of those neighbours.  Somalia denounced Taiwan for becoming friends with Somaliland. Chinese officials travelled to Somaliland and insisted it sever ties with Taiwan.  It is possible that China sees Taiwan's relationship with Somaliland as a potential disruptor of its Belt and Road Initiative, whereby it plans to develop sea and land trade routes across Asia, the Middle East and Africa.  An obstructive Somaliland, with its highly strategic Berbera port, could block the continuity of its Maritime Silk Road along the eastern coast of Africa."
"Ukrainian Ambassador to Singapore Kateryna Zelenko on Friday (Feb 25) said she is grateful for the “strong support” from the Singaporean government, as she urged the international community to stand together against Russia.  “We urge the international community to show solidarity with Ukraine by imposing immediately massive coordinated sanctions against Russia,” she said in an online press briefing.  Her comments come a day after Russia invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea on Thursday. At least 137 people were killed and 316 injured in Ukraine in the first day of fighting, with explosions heard in the capital Kyiv early Friday."
"Beijing is willing to strengthen two-way communication and coordination while deepening exchanges and cooperation, Wang added.  Wang and Pak exchanged views on issues of common concern"", on which the ministry did not elaborate.  The meeting was held in a friendly atmosphere, Pyongyang's state media KCNA said, North Korea's ambassador to China Ri Ryong-nam was also present.  North Korea is officially China's only ally. Both are bound by a treaty signed in 1961 to take all necessary measures, including military assistance, to help each other in the event of an attack or an attempted attack by a third country.  North Korea's Monday missile launch came after the firing of a short-range ballistic missile on Sunday night."""
"Wang said he hopes to deepen exchanges with France in civil nuclear and aerospace, and explore emerging areas such as education and scientific research.  The Chinese premier, in his meeting with Colonna earlier, also took an upbeat stance on broader bilateral ties.  Under the strategic leadership of President Xi Jinping and (French) President (Emmanuel) Macron, the relationship between China and France has been developing better and better in all aspects since this year,"" Li said.

Like several of its neighbours in Southeast Asia, Indonesia is economically intertwined with China as it navigates territorial disputes with its larger neighbor and wants to avoid getting caught in the middle by hostile Washington-Beijing relations.  Jakarta is expected to formally upgrade relations with Washington to the highest diplomatic tier at the meeting. Biden will also announce new funding for Indonesia's semiconductor industry, the people said."""
"The ceremonial splendour of a state visit was deployed to welcome the South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.  King Charles and Queen Camilla greeted the president and his wife at Horse Guards Parade in London.  The royal couple and their guests had a carriage procession along the Mall, lined with South Korean flags, before going inside Buckingham Palace.  Also meeting the South Korean leaders were PM Rishi Sunak and Lord Cameron, now returned as foreign secretary.  More than 1,000 soldiers were on parade, with gun salutes in the autumn leaves in Green Park, as the South Korean president was given a ceremonial welcome, with Prince William and Catherine part of the procession.  State visits are a ""soft power"" mix of pageantry and practical politics - and this was a sign of respect to an increasingly important ally and trade partner, in a region with growing tensions with China."
"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plans to make a state visit to North Korea, the North's state news agency says.  It would be the first time North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has hosted a head of state since assuming power in 2011.  He has undertaken a flurry of diplomatic activity recently, meeting China's president in May, and is expected to attend a summit with Donald Trump this month.  Syria, an ally of the North, has made no comment on the reported plan.  The two countries have been accused of co-operating on chemical weapons. But both nations deny the accusations.  No date for the visit was mentioned by the North Korea's KCNA news agency."

Founder Aston Soon charts the brand’s success story while navigating a crisis and shares his hopes for leaving a legacy.  Back in his secondary school days, Aston Soon recalls going to class with a backpack filled not with textbooks, but with his work uniform for his part time job at the now-defunct American steakhouse, Ponderosa.  He was never really the studious type, and instead found joy in the hustle and bustle of working in a restaurant.

When my manager paged me, I would climb over the school fence and go off to work,” the now 50-year-old shared, chuckling at the memory."

We are in 23 countries, which is quite a lot,” he reflected. As a hotel company founded and based in Singapore, with operations all around the world, Ho believes Banyan Tree is “not in the comfort of a protected home environment”. But the plan has always been to become an international player. “As a Singapore company, you cannot hope to be a major hotel company by just operating within the country,” Ho explained."

"Compared to Singtel and Grab, Sea Limited is less known even if many shoppers may be more familiar with its Shopee platform. The joint winners have the advantage of a trusted brand through Singapore’s largest telecom operator, Singtel, and a ubiquitous brand, Grab.

It’s a tap-in rather than a thunderbolt, a crowd closer to 900 than 90,000, but nothing will steal his moment.  At 16 years and 364 days of age, an early birthday cake waits for him back at his Pasir Ris home, but that can take a back seat. Chua will have the proverbial icing first."
"Nagata was born and grew up in Hawaii, but he moved to Bangkok when he founded his firm in 2006 after leaving WATG (Wimbely, Allison, Tong & Goo), where he started as an intern and left 14 years later as a partner.  “It’s interesting that through my work, I’m able to get in touch with my heritage. I’ve never felt more connected than I do now in Japan. I enjoy going there and starting on new projects because one, I have to research about the particular place I am designing in and two, just dealing with the Japanese, I feel like I’m getting to know myself better,” he reflected."
"The Ukrainian-born winner of a Miss Japan contest has reawakened a long-simmering question on the archipelago: What does it mean to be Japanese?   Karolina Shiino, the 26-year-old winner of this year’s competition, moved to the country when she was five and became a citizen last year. Her unexpected victory in a contest that most years passes little-noticed has sparked a debate on “Japanese-ness” - one that is less simple than you might think.   Not everyone was delighted with Shiino’s victory. But it’s not merely a question of a bigoted older generation pushing back on change.  Almost everyone accepts that according to the rules, Shiino deserves to win the contest. But Miss Japan, a domestic event unrelated to the more familiar Miss World and Miss Universe titles, also explicitly says its goal is to find ""true Japanese beauty""."
"He also told the committee that he had no plans for a ""bloody nose strategy,"" a limited strike on the North. ""We have no bloody nose strategy. I don't know what that is,"" he told Virginia Democrat, Tim Kaine.   ""If we do anything along the kinetic spectrum of conflict, we have to be ready to do the whole thing,"" Harris said.  Harris is the highest-ranking Japanese American in the U.S. military, and the first Asian American to reach the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy. In addition to leading the Pacific Command, he has also served as commander of the Pacific Fleet, the Sixth Fleet and was assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was born in Japan in 1956 to a military family, and he was raised in Tennessee and Florida."
"Grace Jo was born in North Korea and lost most of her family to famine. Her father was killed by the state. Desperate to save her remaining children, her mother defected with them to China, eventually resettling in the U.S.  On the brink of the historic meeting between North Korea and the country she now calls home, Jo spoke with CBS News' Jeff Glor about her earliest memories.  ""I was sitting on the side of the street and we were selling dried fish because at the time we didn't have rice to eat,"" she recalled. ""I was just exhausted, tired, no energy."""
"Bae was born in South Korea and immigrated to the United States in 1985 with his parents and sister. He was allowed to call home on Dec. 29 because of the holidays, according to his sister, Terri Chung. That was the first time his three children from an earlier marriage had spoken to him, she said. He has two children in Arizona and another in Hawaii, ages 17, 22 and 23, Chung said.   Before his arrest, Bae lived in China for seven years with his wife and stepdaughter. He ran a tour business and led 18 trips to North Korea, Chung said."
"He and his older sister were born in South Korea. They were abandoned by their parents in different locations when Alanko was about 4, and Kragt was just a year old.  ""I was told that I was found in a theater which was next to a police station which was actually fairly common in the early 80's in South Korea when there was a lot of poverty,"" said Kragt.  Both children were adopted to families in the U.S. Neither knew about the other.  Decades later, to try and learn about her health history, Alanko did a DNA test through 23andme."
"The U.S. drone killing of American-born and -raised Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a major figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has re-energized a national debate over the legal and moral quandaries of a government deliberately killing a citizen.  The issue has been roiling throughout the U.S. campaign against terrorism, but Friday’s drone missile killing of al-Awlaki and a second American, Samir Khan, provided a stark, concrete case of a U.S. policy that authorizes death for terrorists, even when they’re Americans, analysts said.  A government source who was briefed Friday morning by the CIA confirmed the U.S. missile strike, which killed two other people in a car in Yemen."
"Margrethe’s eldest son, Crown Prince Frederik, took the throne as the new king, while his wife, Crown Princess Mary, became the world’s first Australian-born queen, a development that has delighted her supporters back home.  For many of Mary’s Australian admirers, it’s a fitting finale to a romance that famously began in a rowdy Sydney pub around the time of the Olympics in 2000.  As the story goes, the two locked eyes in the Slip Inn, considered an unlikely place to find a Danish royal, much less the origins of a couple who would later become Denmark’s future king and queen."
"Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen and democracy activist born in China, was sentenced Monday by a court in Beijing, Wong said in a statement, adding that the Australian government was “appalled” by the sentence.  “We understand this can be commuted to life imprisonment after two years if the individual does not commit any serious crimes in the two-year period,” Wong said.  “This is harrowing news for Dr Yang, his family and all who have supported him. Our thoughts are with them.”  Yang, 58, was detained in 2019 at the airport when he arrived in the southern city of Guangzhou with his wife from New York to see family in China."
"“The Board looks forward to working with Mr. Banga on the World Bank Group Evolution process … on all the World Bank Group’s ambitions and efforts aimed at tackling the toughest development challenges facing developing countries,” the bank said.  The World Bank has been led by an American since its founding at the end of World War Two, while the International Monetary Fund has been led by a European.  Banga, who was born in India and spent his early career there, has been a US citizen since 2007.  Banga has met with officials from 96 governments since his nomination, the source said.

"Her mother, Madhur Jaffrey, was born in India’s capital New Delhi and her father, Saeed Jaffrey, hailed from Malerkotla in the northern state of Punjab. Jaffrey learned about the history of India through her mother, as “no Indian history is taught here (in the United States).”  Her mother, born in the 1930s, was an involuntary witness to the deadly period of partition in August 1947, when departing British rulers divided India to create the Muslim nation of Pakistan. “I remember it just being particularly brutal and upsetting to her because she had lots of Muslim friends. And one day, they were gone.”"
"In 1997, Chawla became the first India-born woman to travel into space aboard the space shuttle Columbia. She died on a mission aboard Columbia six years later, along with six other astronauts.  Bandla was born in India’s southern Andhra Pradesh state and began working at Virgin Galactic in 2015, reported CNN affiliate News 18. The company did not immediately respond to an email from CNN Business.  Her flight has sparked excitement among many famous Indians, including the the country’s vice president Venkaiah Naidu, who tweeted that she will be a role model for girls everywhere.  Billionaire and chairman of Mahindra Group, Anand Mahindra, also congratulated Bandla on Twitter (TWTR), and said her flight is a sign that India’s women are “breaking glass ceilings” everywhere."
"Ngo, who was born in Vietnam, started representing her country of birth at 14 after learning how to play from her elderly neighbours, and has over 20 years of professional playing experience.  She married former Singapore player Anthony Kng in 2012, moved to the Republic in 2015 and became a citizen six years later. Despite a seven-year hiatus to raise their daughter, the former world championship silver medallist retained her Midas touch.  Convinced to make a comeback when xiangqi made its debut at the SEA Games in 2022, she won a silver and bronze in Hanoi, and also finished third at the 2022 world championships before clinching an unprecedented SEA Games gold in Phnom Penh in May."
"“The magic of the place is already there, we have to just frame it,” said Dornier, who was born in Germany. He studied architecture at the Berlin University of the Arts before relocating to New York City for work.  In 2013, he moved to Bali to help a friend with a project and was captivated by the way of life on this beautiful Indonesian island. “I got to this part of the world and was very surprised by what it is like to live in a very different context – the atmosphere, the vibe, the people and the opportunities,” he said."
"Sami Michael, Iraqi-born and award-winning Israeli author and activist, dies at 97  Sami Michael, an award-winning Iraqi-Israeli author who was known for writing poignantly about oppressed minorities and the challenges faced by Jews from Arab countries, died on Monday. He was 97.  His characters, who were often Arabic-speaking Jews like himself, opened a window into the particular pains and challenges faced by Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa, as well as his close relationships with Israeli Palestinians in the mixed city of Haifa.  “His characters bridged the divide between Jews and Arabs,” said Itamar Drori, a senior lecturer in literature at Israel’s Bar Ilan University."
"Republican Rep. Mayra Flores of Texas on Tuesday became the first Mexican-born woman to be sworn in to Congress.  “My very first day in office and it’s a memorable one for sure. This is what dreams are made of; faith, family, and hardwork,” Flores tweeted Tuesday.  Flores won a special election in Texas’ 34th Congressional District earlier this month to fill the seat vacated by former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, the first time a congressional seat has changed parties since the 2020 election. She bested a field of four candidates – two Republicans and two Democrats – in the all-party contest."
"When Rep. Victoria Spartz was elected to the House in 2020, she became the first Ukrainian-born member of Congress.  Little did she know that after just one year on the job, that distinction would take on even greater significance as Russia brutally invades her home country and the United States debates what to do about it.  As a freshman, the Indiana Republican is using her microphone in Congress to make passionate pleas for a stronger US response to the rapidly escalating crisis in Ukraine, and hoping her personal connection to the conflict will make the message resonate more strongly. All the while, Spartz is dealing with the emotional toll of watching the bloody invasion unfold, knowing she still has friends and family – including her grandmother – who are in Ukraine."

"Cardiff City defender Perry Ng is enjoying his best season yet in the English Championship, but what the 27-year-old Briton really yearns for is a call-up to the Singapore national football team.  Under Fifa’s rules, the right-back – who was featured in the second-tier league’s Team of the Month for September – is eligible to turn out for Singapore via his late paternal grandfather James, who was born here but later settled in Liverpool.  However, Singapore’s citizenship rules state that qualifying for a passport by descent is applicable only to individuals with at least one parent who is born in Singapore or is a citizen by registration.

"Harry Birtwistle, the young Singapore-born footballer who on Wednesday (Oct 27) signed professional terms with English Premier League (EPL) club Wolverhampton Wanderers, applied to renounce his citizenship, said the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) on Friday (Oct 29).  A Mindef spokesman added that this application was denied.

"Singapore Telecommunications-owned Australian telecom firm Optus has paid a A$1.5 million ($977,250) fine after the local communications watchdog found large-scale breaches of public safety rules around emergency services, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) said on Wednesday.  An investigation by the ACMA has revealed that about 200,000 Optus mobile customers were left at risk due to the failure of the telecommunications company to upload required customer information to a database used by emergency services between January 2021 and September 2023.

"The Dutch government on Monday said that, after an assessment, it won't block Chinese-owned Nexperia's acquisition of Delft-based start-up Nowi.  ""There are no legal objections to the acquisition of Nowi by Nexperia,"" Economic Affairs Minister Micky Adriaansens said in a letter to parliament.  Nexperia, owned by China's Wingtech , bought Nowi, which has around 40 employees, for an undisclosed sum in 2022. But the Dutch government decided to vet the deal retroactively in May 2023 after it established a new office to review foreign takeovers of potentially sensitive technologies.  Nowi makes power management chips that can use ambient sources of electricity such as light or vibrations as a power source - potentially useful as a way to remove the need for batteries in simple electronic devices."

"When nasi lemak stall Wild Coco opened at a hip Balestier kopitam last year, it gained popularity for being the cheaper, humbler “kopitiam version” of Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant The Coconut Club, thanks to their similar offerings of gourmet Malaysian-style nasi lemak.  On Sep 28, the stall relocated to a proper full-service, air-conditioned restaurant.  Wild Coco is owned by Wayne Tan, 44, who’s also behind laksa stall Laksa Labo within his old kopitam space. This means all Labo’s laksa items, including the Classic Laksa (S$8.90), are also on the menu at Wild Coco.  Wild Coco specialises in “Malaysian-style” nasi lemak, which according to Tan is about prepping components like coconut rice, anchovies and sambal in specific ways, such as ensuring the sambal is potent and less sweet."

The affected models are Daihatsu's Grand Max, Toyota's TownAce and Mazda Motor's Bongo.  Daihatsu, which has been a wholly owned Toyota subsidiary since 2016, is popular for its lineup of small-sized vehicles in Japan and in Southeast Asia.

"China's ByteDance-owned TikTok posted revenue of about US$16 billion last year in the United States, where the viral video app that has hooked Gen Z users is at the risk of being banned, the Financial Times reported on Friday (Mar 15).  ByteDance's revenue of US$120 billion in 2023 was up about 40 per cent from a year earlier, driven by TikTok's exploding growth, although China accounts for a big portion of the company's sales, the FT reported, citing five people with knowledge of the matter.

Beaumont Capital and RGE are separate entities, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. A Beaumont spokesperson told Reuters that Beaumont Capital is an investment holding company owned by Belinda."
"Thanks to the panda in its name and logo, you’d be forgiven for assuming that foodpanda is Asian-owned.  In actuality, the ubiquitous food delivery platform was founded in Singapore in 2012, but is now owned by Berlin-based Delivery Hero, which acquired the business in 2016. It is listed on the German DAX, following an IPO in 2017.  So, oddly enough, while the foodpanda brand remains most active in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) market, you would just as easily find its pink-garbed riders plying the streets of Romania and Bulgaria – the two Eastern European markets where the company has a presence – today."
"The US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a Bill on Wednesday (Mar 13) that would give TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the US assets of the short-video app, or face a ban, in the greatest threat to the app since the Trump administration.  The Bill passed 352-65, with bipartisan support, but it faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favour a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps posing security concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will review the legislation.  The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to US national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at US ports."

"Australia's second-largest telco, Optus, had no crisis plan when a network-wide outage left nearly half the country without phone or internet for 12 hours, an executive told parliament on Friday (Nov 17), acknowledging the company's defences had failed.  The Singapore Telecommunications-owned company had recently war-gamed scenarios in which the routers that direct voice and internet data failed in entire states, but it never expected a nationwide shutdown because it had alternate connections built into its network.  ""We didn't have a plan in place for that specific scale of outage,"" Optus managing director of networks Lambo Kanagaratnam told a Senate hearing on the Nov 8 failure that left much of the country unable to make payments, receive healthcare or contact emergency services for most of a day."
"With a storage capacity of 170,000 cubic meters and a regasification capacity of 300 million standard cubic feet per day (MMcsfd), Jawa Satu will receive LNG for power generation from LNG carriers via ship-to-ship transfer before supplying it to the Jawa 1 power plant.  The plant, which also began operations on March 29 by PT Jawa Satu Power, has a generating capacity of 1,760 megawatts and is located in Cilamaya, West Java, the company added. It is also jointly owned by Pertamina, Marubeni and Sojitz.  Electricity generated by the power plant will be supplied to Indonesian state-owned electricity company PT PLN (Persero) for 25 years."
"Two former employees of the now-defunct Sembcorp Marine and a subsidiary were charged on Thursday (Mar 28) with bribing Brazilian officials to advance their companies' interests in the South American country.  Sembcorp Marine was one of Singapore's two main offshore and marine companies before it became Seatrium in 2023 following a merger with Keppel Offshore & Marine (KOM).  The alleged offences took place between 2009 and 2014, where a total sum of around US$44 million (S$59.3 million) was handed out via a Brazilian middleman known as Guilherme Esteves de Jesus (GDJ), according to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in a joint news release on Thursday.  The first accused is Wong Weng Sun, 62, who was the president, executive director and CEO of Sembcorp Marine, and managing director of its wholly owned subsidiary Jurong Shipyard (JSPL) at the time of the alleged offences."
"The US Treasury Department in a statement said it targeted the Shwe Byain Phyu Group of Companies, its owner Thein Win Zaw, his wife and two adult children.  Treasury said the company imports and distributes petroleum for the military and has a profit-sharing relationship with military conglomerate Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd, which Washington imposed sanctions on in 2021.  Washington also targeted MEHL-owned shipping company Myanmar Five Star Line, which it said ships material for domestic weapons production for the military.  The Treasury Department said the two entities have enabled the purchase of foreign currency and the import of petroleum and other materials on behalf of the junta."
"As Indonesia orders safety audits for vital state facilities, some fertiliser manufacturing plants have come under the spotlight.  A number of these plants are classified as vital because they play an important role in ensuring food security in the country.  The increased attention to such facilities comes on the back of a deadly blaze in March at a fuel depot in North Jakarta operated by state-owned energy company Pertamina.  The fire spread to a settlement next to the facility, killing 33 residents.  The incident led to the government ordering safety audits for vital state facilities across the country to prevent a similar incident."
"Trust Bank is aiming to become Singapore’s fourth-largest retail bank in terms of customer numbers by the end of next year. It is also targeting to break even in 2025.  The digital bank is 60 per cent owned by Standard Chartered and 40 per cent by NTUC’s enterprise arm. It holds a full bank licence, which means it is able to offer services similar to those of conventional banks such as having physical ATMs.  Its competitors include GXS Bank, which is backed by Grab and Singtel GXS Bank, and MariBank which is owned by tech giant Sea.  Both GXS and MariBank hold “digital full bank” licences which permit the offering of online-only banking services to retail and corporate customers. These retail digital banks are also subject to a cap of S$50 million in deposits during the entry phase."
"One Degree North, which first started as a delivery-only Asian roast joint, put itself on the radar of foodies last year when it clinched a 2023 Michelin Bib Gourmand award in Seoul (it was announced in October 2022) under the watch of its owner, Joel Lim.  A Singaporean millennial, Lim’s journey could have moved in a completely different trajectory. A role in the kitchen, not to mention being the owner of it, requires a combination of mental and physical involvement at every step of the way. The easier way out would have been to simply take over his father’s business QuicSeal, a company that manufactures and supplies products which include waterproofing, tile adhesives, joint sealants, epoxies, concrete repair mortar. However, after a two-year stint with Singapore Airlines as a flight attendant and another two more as a project manager for a sales company, Lim felt it was time to take his career into his own hands. “I don’t want to be known as an ‘ah sia kia’ (a Singlish term describing those with rich parents),” he shared."
"Indonesia's biggest geothermal company PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy, which is state-owned, is hoping to export clean energy to neighbouring countries as the region looks towards green alternatives and away from fossil fuels.   Indonesia sits on the Ring of Fire, an area with some of the most active volcanoes in the world, resulting in an abundance of geothermal resources.   The country has 40 per cent of the world's potential geothermal resources, with an estimated 24 gigawatt of reserves ready to be cultivated. But currently, it is harnessing just 10 per cent of this energy potential.  As the push for renewables grows more urgent in the fight against climate change, observers say it must be full steam ahead for geothermal companies to harvest more green energy."
"Laguna Phuket, owned by Singapore-based Banyan Tree Holdings, is giving buyers a free 10-year visa for Thailand with the purchase of any new property.  It also offers a refundable reservation fee that allows buyers to reserve their property of choice while still providing them with an option to change their minds when circumstances allow for an in-person visit.  Utopia Group also pivoted during the pandemic, developing an app that allowed potential buyers to do detailed off-site inspections.  While these innovations have done their bit in keeping things moving, transaction volumes have been hampered by buyers not being able to come and view properties and close deals."
"Berkshire Hathaway-owned Dairy Queen is exploring options to expand in new markets, perhaps including Taiwan, the company's CEO said, even as geopolitical concerns with China simmer.  Owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway since 1998, the fast-food chain counts China as its second-largest market, operating more than 1,250 stores there out of more than 7,000 worldwide.   Tensions between the United States and China have been rising, with some investors worried that China might invade or seek to reunify Taiwan soon.  Troy Bader, chief executive of International Dairy Queen Inc, said the company often looks to markets adjacent to existing ones, so it can take advantage of existing supply chains, when considering where to expand."
"Caerus Holding may be named after the Greek mythological persona of opportunity, luck and favourable moments. But its CEO Vijay K. Pillai is all carpe diem when it comes to pursuing cult brands to open in Singapore.  In 2016, Pillai emailed Jakob Baer Mogensen, chef-owner of Danish pastry brand Leckerbaer to propose the idea of opening in Singapore after researching and reading rave reviews about them online. When he received a somewhat reserved reply, he lost no time in convincing Mogensen to let him fly over from the UK for a meeting the next day.  “This in spite of him saying that his wife was giving birth that evening,” said Pillai, with an embarrassed chuckle at the memory of his insistence. “The moment I landed, I took a taxi to his store, tried the products, thought they were great, and talked to him for about an hour. Then he said. ‘I gotta go. My wife’s going into labour soon.’ My first trip to Copenhagen literally lasted three hours.”"
"Dependence on China in key materials and technologies has become a major issue for Europe, particular Germany, which has asked its biggest corporations to de-risk, which essentially means lowering Chinese exposure in the supply chain.  However, a new strategy for Germany in its dealings with China faces delays over policy differences within the government, three sources told Reuters, adding it will not be in place in time for bilateral talks scheduled for June 20.  Siemens Gamesa last month signed a deal with Australia's Arafura Rare Earths to procure 200 tonnes of materials needed for permanent magnets a year, helping the Siemens Energy owned company to diversify away from China."
"CNOOC's Brazilian subsidiary owns 7.34 per cent of the Buzios shared reservoir, which is 88.99 per cent owned by Brazilian state-owned oil and gas company Petrobras. CNOOC paid US$1.9 billion to Petrobras last year to secure a 5 per cent stake in a production sharing agreement at the field.  CNOOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  State-owned CNOOC is China's largest offshore oil and gas producer, and has invested in a number of more technically challenging fields overseas as it seeks to ramp up production.  The company previously reported that output from its international operations in the first quarter increased 16.6 per cent versus last year."
"YouTube will launch its first official shopping channel for live commerce in South Korea on Jun 30, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday (Jun 21).  South Korea already has a booming live-streaming commerce business led by tech giant Naver, making it a prime test market for the global heavyweight as the Alphabet-owned company focuses on becoming more ""shoppable"".  The new channel will operate in the Korean language and will start as a 90-day project. In the beginning, it will provide a live-commerce platform to companies and plans to livestream shopping content from about 30 brands, Yonhap and other Korean media said, citing people familiar with the matter."
"NATIONAL GRID VS LOCAL HERO  While Rasid and his friends were building the plant, Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) finally announced plans to expand the national power grid to Andungbiru.  Once again, tongues started wagging. “They said, ‘Rasid is stupid. There’s now electricity supply but he still wants to create energy plant.'""  But these people soon began to sing a different tune.  While Rasid continued to charge households around Rp67,000 (US$5) a month for power, neighbours who switched to PLN were being charged around Rp270,000 (US$30) - six times as much.  To make things worse, PLN’s electricity supply wasn’t as reliable."
"Multi-currency mobile wallet operator YouTrip on Thursday (Oct 26) announced it has raised another US$50 million in funding.  The funds were raised from global venture capital firm Lightspeed for its Series B round. Lightspeed has also invested in Snapchat-owner Snap and tech company Stripe.  YouTrip previously raised US$30 million in 2021 and US$25.5 million in 2019.  Nearly five years after its launch, the Singapore-based app has become operationally profitable, chief executive officer Caecilia Chu told CNA in an interview.  YouTrip now processes US$10 billion in payments annually – comprising money that users spend while travelling overseas, shopping on international sites and corporate spending by small- and medium-size enterprises using YouBiz."
"A vessel that used to be operated by Genting Hong Kong-owned Dream Cruises will sail from Jun 15 under a new company called Resorts World Cruises.  The company was set up by Malaysian tycoon Lim Kok Thay, who is chairman and board executive of Genting Group. It was registered on Mar 9, less than two months after Genting Hong Kong filed to wind up the company after failing to secure funding to pay its debts.  Dream Cruises ran three ships - Genting Dream, Explorer Dream and World Dream. Resorts World Cruises has taken over Genting Dream and is currently in negotiations with banks and interested parties to acquire the other two ships."
"Japan's Fast Retailing Co, owner of clothing brand Uniqlo, posted a 25 per cent jump in first quarter operating profit on Thursday fuelled by strong overseas sales as it charts a third-straight year of record earnings.  Profit was 146.7 billion yen ($1.01 billion) in the three months through November compared with 117.1 billion yen a year earlier.  The consensus forecast was for 137.9 billion yen, according to the average estimate of five analysts surveyed by LSEG.  Fast Retailing held its full-year operating profit forecast of 450 billion yen, following record earnings of 381.1 billion yen in fiscal 2023.  Among individual regions, Uniqlo's business in mainland China reported a large increase in revenue and profit in the first quarter, the company said in a statement."
"Sarawak Energy aims to install at least 400 megawatts (MW) of floating solar power capacity at its dams by 2030 as the Malaysian utility expands to meet rising demand for renewables from neighbouring countries, its group chief executive said.  The company owned by the Malaysian state of Sarawak, which produces most of its power from hydroelectric dams, is expanding into solar capacity as it seeks to reduce reliance on coal and ramp up exports to neighbouring Sabah state, and countries such as Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore.  Sarawak Energy started construction at its first 50 MW floating solar unit at its Batang Ai dam this month which is expected to be completed by end-2024, CEO Sharbini Suhaili told Reuters on Tuesday on the sidelines of an Energy Asia conference."
"A new locally made brand of milk powder, costing less than S$40 a tin, was launched on Tuesday (May 30), amid public concern over the rising prices of formula milk.  The made-in-Singapore formula, Einmilk, is owned by local company AE Solution and manufactured here by SMC Nutrition. Separately, supermarket chain FairPrice is exploring ways to bring in more formula milk products, as well as developing its own house-brand milk powder, a spokesman told Channel NewsAsia.  The developments come about a week after the Government formed a taskforce to address the rising prices of formula milk in Singapore.  LEVERAGING THE SINGAPORE BRAND  Einmilk business director Chan Yong Chye said that his company wants to leverage the Singapore brand and produce the item locally, which it hopes can soften price inflation."
"Changes to laws to strengthen the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore's (MUIS) ability to oversee all Muslim religious schools were passed in Parliament on Monday (Feb 5).  Under the amendments to the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA), MUIS will be allowed to take enforcement action against any of such schools which are unregistered.  A definition of Muslim religious schools will also be introduced, and there will be inspection powers for MUIS officers.  Tabling the Bill for a second reading, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the changes will ensure that Islamic religious education in Singapore is conducted by accredited institutions and asatizah (religious teachers) with the necessary qualifications."
"All men between 18 and 35 years old and all women aged between 18 and 27 will have to serve up to two years in the military if called up.  There will be a higher age limit of 45 for men and 35 for women – and a longer three-year term of service – for some vocations such as doctors and engineers.  The length of service can be extended to five years during a state of emergency – a situation Myanmar has been in since the coup.  Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun told media at least 13 million people will be eligible. The country’s population was reported at 55 million in 2021.   He said each recruitment batch would involve 5,000 conscripts, with the first intake in mid-April after Myanmar's new year holiday known as Thingyan."
"The US government has announced new regulations that aim to keep Chinese batteries out of cars sold in the United States, a move that could push up the price of electric vehicles for American drivers.  The Biden administration on Friday proposed rules that would cut subsidies for vehicles that contain Chinese-made battery components, or are found to be produced by a company with strong ties to the Chinese government.  China is the world’s leader in EV battery production, dominating almost “every stage of the EV battery supply chain,” according to a 2023 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).  Starting next month, following a 30-day period for public comment, vehicles with these components will no longer be eligible for a full $7,500 US tax credit, which allows consumers to save money when buying a new electric car."
"Two new bills meant to protect children’s mental health online by changing the way they are served content on social media and by limiting companies’ use of their data will be introduced in the New York state legislature, state and city leaders said Wednesday.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York Attorney General Letitia James made the announcement at the headquarters of the United Federation of Teachers Manhattan, joined by UFT President Michael Mulgrew, State Senator Andrew Gounardes, Assemblywoman Nily Rozic and community advocates.  “Our children are in crisis, and it is up to us to save them,” Hochul said, comparing social media algorithms to cigarettes and alcohol. “The data around the negative effects of social media on these young minds is irrefutable, and knowing how dangerous the algorithms are, I will not accept that we are powerless to do anything about it.”"
"Online fast-fashion retailer Shein must face the European Union's strictest level of digital regulations, the bloc said on Friday (Apr 26) as it added the company to its list of big platforms that need extra scrutiny.  The EU's Executive Commission said it formally classed Shein as a “very large online platform” under the 27-nation bloc's Digital Services Act, an expansive rulebook designed to clean up online platforms and keep internet users safe.  Shein is a low-cost online retailer that was founded in China but is now based in Singapore. It reaches customers mainly through its app. It didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment."
"The statutory board under the Ministry of Health governs and regulates the professional conduct and ethics of registered medical practitioners.  According to an October 2022 paper in the Singapore Medical Journal, a survey of 1,000 individuals aged 21 and above in Singapore found that misuse of prescription medicine was common, “with prevalence comparable to the use of recreational drugs or novel psychoactive substances”.  The survey, conducted back in 2015, also found that a “common source” of misused drugs was physicians.  And this hasn’t seemed to change in recent times, according to addiction counsellors who spoke to CNA.  Mr Andy Leach, director of addictions services at Visions by Promises, has seen clients who visited “eight to 10"" doctors for the same medication. "
"A chicken shortage had been observed in local markets lately, and the Agriculture and Food Industries Ministry (MAFI) said rising production costs, disease infection and weather conditions were among the factors that have affected operations and supply.   MAFI added that the government had set aside RM729.32 million as subsidy to help alleviate the burden on producers, but only RM50 million has been paid so far. It promised to speed up subsidy payments to the breeders.  The approved permit (AP) for chicken, an import quota approval system, had been abolished by the government earlier this month to ensure adequate food supply in Malaysia. "
"Kejriwal, whose Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) governs the national capital territory and the northern state of Punjab, was arrested last week by the federal financial crime-fighting agency on corruption charges, weeks before India begins voting in general elections on Apr 19.  AAP, all of whose main leaders are now imprisoned in connection with the case, says he has been ""falsely arrested"" in a ""fabricated case"". The federal government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) deny political interference.  ""India's legal processes are based on an independent judiciary which is committed to objective and timely outcomes. Casting aspersions on that is unwarranted,"" the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement."
"In the case of the Swatch watches, for example, the watches were seized first before a gazette of the ban was made almost three months later. Similarly, the two books seized by the ministry from Mr Amir’s bookshop on Aug 18 have not been banned.  The Malaysian Bar - the body that regulates the profession of lawyers in the country - tells CNA that the legality of the raids and seizures remains questionable and is subject to challenge in court.   “Under the PPPA, the Minister of MOHA is first expected to make an order published in the gazette regarding the prohibition of any undesirable publications,” a spokesman for the Malaysian Bar says in response to queries from CNA. "
"Malaysia’s proposed Control of Tobacco Products and Smoking Bill 2022, an omnibus law on tobacco control, aims to phase out cigarette smoking and vape products by prohibiting their use and sale to everyone born from 2007 onwards.  The bill, along with its “generational end game” measure, has received praise for being visionary. But some say that it will infringe on personal liberties and criminalise minors.  Malaysia’s concerted efforts in tobacco control began in the 1990s with the Control of Tobacco Products Regulations, which have been strengthened through several amendments. These measures include establishing smoke-free public spaces, requiring pictorial health warnings on cigarette packets and a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship."
"The government will make various efforts to globalise the financial industry, especially to build a more favourable environment for foreign financial firms, Kim said.  ""In a broad framework, we will continue efforts to improve the attractiveness of the Korean market to foreign investors.""  Officials of 10 foreign firms, such as HSBC, JP Morgan and Societe Generale, attended the meeting, the FSC said.  Among the regulatory reforms South Korea adopted last year to boost foreign access to its financial markets was the scrapping of a 30-year-old rule that foreigners must register with authorities in order to trade listed stocks.  In November, however, it imposed a sudden temporary ban on stock short-selling through the first half of 2024, after authorities uncovered some illegal trades by foreign firms."
"SINGAPORE: The government will set up a new inter-ministerial committee to review Singapore's anti-money laundering regime and ensure it stays up to date with increasingly sophisticated crimes, said Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah in parliament on Tuesday (Oct 3).  Ms Indranee will chair the new committee, comprising political office holders from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and four ministries: Home Affairs, Law, Manpower, and Trade and Industry.  The committee will focus on four areas:  How to better prevent corporate structures from being abused by money launderers  How financial institutions can enhance their controls and collaborate more effectively with each other and authorities to guard against and flag suspicious transactions"
"China's securities regulator has published draft rules aimed at cutting trading commissions for mutual funds and addressing the conflict of interest between the securities trading and fund sales businesses of brokerages, the latest reform to the $3.8 trillion mutual fund industry.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said the proposals were designed to protect investors and better regulate the way fund managers allocate trading commissions.  The rules, published by the CSRC for public consultation on Friday, are the latest attempt by authorities to revive confidence in the sluggish stock market and comes five months after the regulator urged mutual funds to cut management fees and reduce costs for investors."
"NIIGATA, Japan : Finance ministers and central banks from the Group of Seven rich nations agreed the global financial system is resilient but the need for vigilance remains, Japan's finance minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Saturday.  The officials issued a joint statement vowing to address regulatory gaps in the banking system discovered during recent problems at U.S. and Swiss banks, and said they would continue to work closely with supervisory and regulatory authorities to monitor financial sector developments.  ""We reaffirm that our financial system is resilient, supported by the financial regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis, including considerable increases in the levels of bank capital and liquidity, an international framework for effectively resolving failing institutions, and strengthened cross-border regulatory and supervisory cooperation,"" it said."
"SEOUL: South Korea's vice financial regulator chief said on Thursday (Dec 14) that authorities would take innovation more into account in the next stage of regulating cryptocurrencies.  Regulations need to have a balance between investor protection and technological innovation, said Kim So-young, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, at a conference held in Seoul on digital currencies.  The conference was held by the South Korean government and central bank, jointly with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), following the Bank of Korea's launch of a project in October to develop a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC).  South Korea this year enacted legislation on virtual assets to bring cryptocurrency markets under regulatory control for investor protection. It will come into effect from July 2024."
"MUMBAI : Financial technology companies should create a self-regulatory body to address their needs and challenges, the Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Wednesday, as the industry grows at a break-neck speed due to surging demand for digital payments and borrowings.  ""I would like to use this opportunity to urge and encourage the fintechs to establish a self-regulatory organisation or SRO themselves. From the Reserve Bank, we are willing to engage with you,"" Das said while delivering the keynote address at the Global FinTech Fest 2023 (GFF).  ""It (SRO) will give you (fintechs) an opportunity to voice your requirements more frequently to the SRO. The other advantage is that all the aspects of regulation will not be burdened on the Reserve Bank."""
"Both Meta and TikTok designate Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that governs Gaza, a ""dangerous organisation"" and ban content praising it.  Hamas members attacked communities in southern Israel on Oct 7. Israel says some 1,400 people including children were killed, and more than 200 people, some of them infants, were taken hostage in the assault.  The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that 7,028 Palestinians had been killed in Israel's retaliatory air strikes, including 2,913 children.  Reuters could not independently verify the tolls.  Since the violence erupted, both social media firms have taken steps to improve moderation, and remove or label graphic visuals."
"SINGAPORE: Authorities on Wednesday (Aug 24) imposed penalties on commodity trader Noble Group (NGL) and issued stern warnings to former directors of its then-wholly-owned subsidiary Noble Resources International (NRI) after both were found to have inflated reported profits and net assets.   A civil penalty of S$12.6 million was imposed on NGL by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for publishing misleading information in its financial statements in breach of the Securities and Futures Act, a joint press release by the MAS, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Singapore Police Force issued on Wednesday stated.  ACRA, in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, also issued stern warnings to two former directors of NRI for failing to prepare and table annual financial statements in compliance with the prescribed accounting standards, in breach of the Companies Act. "
"Since January 8th, the government has not approved new arms export permits to Israel and this will continue until we can ensure full compliance with our export regime.  Canadian law bars the export of weapons if they could be used in ""a serious violation of international humanitarian law"" or ""serious acts of violence against women and children"".  Canada's parliament passed a non-binding motion on Monday on the Gaza conflict which called on the government to ""cease the further authorisation and transfer of arms exports to Israel"".  Canada, a minor supplier of arms to Israel, last week said it had paused non-lethal military exports since January because of the rapidly evolving situation on the ground."
"China published new draft measures on Thursday aimed at bolstering its new data security law, including definitions of what it considered """"core"""" and """"important"""" data.  China implemented the Data Security Law on Sept. 1. which requires all companies in China to classify the data they handle into several categories and governs how such data is stored and transferred to other parties.  But lawyers have criticised its ambiguities including its lack of definitions for data.  Thursday's draft measures describe in detail three categories of data - ordinary data, important data, and core data.  The authorities describe ordinary data as data with a minimal ability to impact society at large, or that will affect a small number of individuals or enterprises."
"After an emergency meeting to discuss the repercussions of the attack, Borrell also said an ""overwhelming majority"" of EU foreign ministers supported continuing aid payments for the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank.  Borrell made his statement the day after European Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi, a Hungarian diplomat, said all EU development aid for Palestinians was suspended - only for the Commission to disown his announcement after a backlash from EU governments.  Borrell had invited the Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers to take part by video conference in the meeting in Muscat, Oman.  But Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen did not want to participate in a meeting that would also be addressed by Palestinian Authority minister Riyad al-Maliki so neither ended up taking part, officials said."
"Public Transport Council (PTC) chief executive Tan Kim Hong will step down on Mar 1, 2024 after about seven years at the helm.  Deputy group director of policy and planning at the Land Transport Authority (LTA) Leow Yew Chin will be appointed as chief executive (designate) of PTC from Sep 1, before taking over from Mr Tan on Mar 1 next year, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Friday (Aug 11).  The PTC regulates public transport fares and ticket payment services, as well as advises the Minister for Transport on public transport matters.  Mr Tan was appointed chief executive of PTC on Jul 1, 2017. During his time, he oversaw six fare review exercises and a mid-term review on the Network Capacity Factor, where he sought to balance the need to ensure fare affordability and the financial sustainability of Singapore's public transport system."
"Parliament on Wednesday (Nov 30) passed legislation to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Singapore amid a rise in registrations.  More than 10 per cent of new light vehicle registrations were EVs this year, up from 0.3 per cent in 2020. Half of all EVs were registered to condominium and Housing Board (HDB) residents, said Transport Minister S Iswaran.   In his opening speech on an Electric Vehicles Charging Bill, Mr Iswaran said the land transport sector, which accounts for about 15 per cent of emissions, will play a key role in achieving Singapore’s aim of net-zero emissions by 2050 through the electrification of the vehicle population.  "
"India on Friday (Nov 10) introduced a new draft broadcasting law to regulate the sector that will also apply to streaming giants such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon and calls for the formation of individual content evaluation committees.  Netflix and Amazon have become hugely popular in India, which is set to grow into a US$7 billion market for the sector by 2027, according to Media Partners Asia. Top Bollywood stars feature in online shows, some of which have faced criticism from lawmakers and the public for scenes deemed vulgar or offensive to religious sentiments.  The minister for information and broadcasting, Anurag Thakur, said setting up Content Evaluation Committees (CEC) by each broadcaster was among ""key innovations"" in the new law and will help in ""robust self-regulation""."
"EXPORT SANCTIONS The Singapore Strategic Goods Control System regulates the transfer - export, transit, and transhipment - of strategic goods which are generally military weapons or their parts as well as high technology goods that could be used for both commercial and military purposes.  Items subject to strategic goods control are listed in the Strategic Goods (Control) Order (SGCO) 2021.  In order to “constrain Russia’s capacity to conduct war in Ukraine and cyber aggression”, all permit operations to Russia involving all items on the list of military goods under the SGCO will be rejected.  All category codes under Category 3 (Electronics), Category 4 (Computers) and Category 5 (Telecommunications) and Information Security on the List of Dual-Use Goods under the SGCO will also be rejected."
"The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has put in place new measures to keep digital payment token (DPT) service providers out of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  On April 2, it amended the Payment Services Act and its subsidiary legislation to expand the scope of payment services under the central bank’s regulation.  This is to enhance user protection and financial stability by imposing more requirements on DPT service providers, said MAS, one day after announcing the first centralised digital platform Cosmic to combat illegal financing and money laundering.  The Payment Services Act will include three more activities under its regulation:"
"Feng was removed last week from his position as head of the publishing unit of the Communist Party's Publicity Department, the sources said. The department oversees the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), which, in turn, regulates China's vast video games sector.  The sources said Feng's removal was linked to rules the NPPA announced last month that sent stocks in the world's largest video games sector, including industry giant Tencent, plunging.  The Chinese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Feng's removal and Reuters was unable to obtain his contact details to reach him for a comment."
"Japan's Cabinet on Tuesday (Mar 26) eased strict transfer rules for military equipment to allow the export of next-generation fighter jets being developed with Britain and Italy.  The three countries are pooling their know-how in cutting-edge air combat technology to develop the jet, which they hope will be ready by 2035.  Government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said the Cabinet had approved the change to Japan's arms export rules, following agreement by the ruling coalition earlier this month.  Previously the export of military equipment to a third country was forbidden, although there have been some exceptions in recent years.  ""The plan to make fighter jets with capabilities essential for the security of our nation must be realised, to ensure that our nation's defences won't be compromised,"" Hayashi told reporters."
"“For example, the scope of betting will go beyond horse racing and sporting events to include the outcome of any competition, event or process,” MHA said, adding that financial products regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore will not be considered gambling.  Separately, a Gambling Regulatory Authority of Singapore (GRA) Bill – also introduced on Monday – proposes to set up the Gambling Regulatory Authority around mid-2022. The authority will regulate the entire gambling landscape in Singapore which is currently overseen by multiple agencies.  At the moment, the Casino Regulatory Authority regulates the casinos, MHA’s Gambling Regulatory Unit regulates online gambling services and fruit machines, the Singapore Totalisator Board governs physical gambling services operated by Singapore Pools, and the police enforces against unlawful gambling activities."
"With few tourists coming to Singapore due to travel restrictions, hotels have turned to relying on domestic demand for staycations and dining as their primary source of revenue.   To boost domestic tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board in December 2020 gave S$100 worth of SingapoRediscovers vouchers that could be used for local hotel stays, attractions tickets and tours.  Soon after the vouchers were distributed, several hotels made the news after long queues formed at their check-in counters, with some guests saying they had to wait several hours until their rooms were ready.  One such guest, who wanted to be known only as Ms Goh, said that she had to queue outside the Grand Park City Hall hotel in March last year for 1.5 hours before she could check in."
"On Tuesday, Mr Wee had asked whether the ministry will consider reviewing the safety measures and criteria for suitable conditions for military demonstrations such as free fall jumps and parachute landings.  He also asked if the defence ministry will consider limiting such exercises to training operations only.  In his reply, Dr Ng also said that the measured surface wind speeds during the Red Lion rehearsals and National Day Parade were within the acceptable range stipulated in the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) safety regulations.  The review committee, which is led by the SAF Inspector-General Office, includes independent experts outside the SAF in sky diving and military freefall, he added."
"NOT A SURPRISE FOR INDUSTRY FOLLOWERS  It is hard to imagine how regulators did not realise MYAirline was in financial distress.  In Malaysia, the Malaysia Aviation Commission (Mavcom) regulates economic matters and ensures airlines are financially fit while the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) is responsible for making sure an airline meets technical requirements, including safety.  While it is not unusual for an airline to cease operations, particularly a start-up airline, it is unusual for regulators not to be aware of airlines’ financial issues, and not to hold regular discussions with struggling airlines.  The Malaysia government immediately expressed its disappointment, with Transport Minister Anthony Loke calling MYAirline irresponsible and stating that “Mavcom was caught completely off guard”."
"Ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Japan prohibited the unauthorised resale of event tickets above their sale price. The punishment was up to one year’s imprisonment, a fine of up to ¥1 million (S$10,200), or both.  In Australia’s New South Wales, it is an offence to resell a ticket at more than 10 per cent above its original face value. A similar rule is in place in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.  Could the answer lie in restricting the profit margin for ticket resales, as these governments have done?  Singapore has resisted such moves. In 2019, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said that the profit margin resellers can command is freely determined between willing buyers and sellers."
"These changes will also strengthen laws governing digital payment tokens (DPTs) to ensure companies issuing such tokens protect the assets of their users, said Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who is a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) board member.  Parliament passed the Payment Services (Amendment) Bill on Monday following a roughly two-hour debate that saw 10 MPs taking part.  Under the changes, Singapore will implement enhanced standards for virtual asset service providers which deal in DPTs, otherwise known as cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies have been gaining popularity internationally since the introduction of the first one, bitcoin, in 2009.  Over the past weekend, it was reported that bitcoin saw its price pass US$30,000 (S$39,632) for the first time, according to data compiled by the Bloomberg news agency.  Previously, MAS only regulated cryptocurrency service providers when they possessed money or the cryptocurrency itself - but this has now been expanded."

(S//NF) In preparing for the 26 to 27 April visit to Washington by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) apparently wanted to come up with a simple message regarding climate change with which the U.S. can agree. Accordingly, METI has pushed three principles: technical development, energy conservation and nuclear energy, and participation of all countries in the future framework. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) apparently wants Abe to mention at the bilateral summit Japan's goal of reducing carbon emissions by half by 2050 as part of the ""Abe initiative,"" which will be announced in late May. The MFA was considering not informing the U.S. in advance of its intention, because the ministry did not expect Washington to approve of such a goal, based on the U.S. reaction to climate change issues so far. It was apparently decided at a briefing at the Prime Minister's official residence that Abe will clearly state the goal at the bilateral summit, with advance notification to the United States.

"""Tokyo's Climate Change Officials to Continue Promoting Sectoral 
Approach (TS//SI//NF)

(TS//SI//NF) Japanese climate change officials apparently plan to continue promoting the sectoral approach despite criticism from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and some European Union officials. Fatih Birol, Chief Economist of the IEA, reportedly warned the Japanese in mid­-May that they are pushing too hard to promote the sectoral approach and may be perceived as offering this approach as the only option for reducing carbon emissions. He also cautioned that the sectoral approach is not yet understood and that Tokyo must clarify the concept and promote understanding and trust among the nations concerned. Masakazu Toyoda of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry expressed frustration at this criticism then laid out three advantages of the sectoral approach: first, the approach is designed to get China, India, and the U.S. on board; second, this approach allows developed countries to avoid expending unnecessary efforts to reduce carbon emissions in areas covered by the sectoral approach; and third, the sectoral approach will, in Toyoda's estimation, not result in any economic or industrial loss for developed or developing nations. One Japanese official thinks that it may be difficult for the Europeans to implement the sectoral approach in sectors such as electricity, which is already subject to the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). He suggested that the ultimate solution is dependent upon the EU accepting a method of determining a figure for total carbon emissions reductions that includes the electricity sector. Toyoda claimed that businesses from several sectors  ­including steel, aluminum, cement, and petroleum­­are threatening to cease their European operations if the ETS continues as is."

(TS//SI//OC/NF) Officials in the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) appeared recently to be seeking ways to prevent damage to relations with the U.S. over the ministry's decision to delay the importation of U.S.-­origin cherries, a decision driven by Japanese politicians and growers. MAFF was alarmed by the very strong reaction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Tokyo's ruling that imports could not commence until the end of this month, when a pilot program involving inspections in the U.S. Pacific Northwest by a MAFF inspector is expected to be concluded satisfactorily. One approach under consideration is to have the ministry admit to Washington, through back channels, that the decision had been the product of political pressure. Also, it was recommended that the U.S. be notified that­­unlike in the beef dispute­­imports could begin as soon as the result of on­site inspection is confirmed, rather than after the inspector had returned to Japan and more tests conducted. The principal fear among the Japanese is that the issue will become similarly politicized, possibly at senior levels, in Washington.

"The EU and Japan were engaged as of early December in strategy sessions aimed at a common handling policy to deal with potential U.S. moves in the Doha Round negotiations. There was a conviction in both Brussels and Tokyo, according to Japanese reporting, that great care must be taken to avoid falling prey to U.S. moves designed to extort concessions through exaggerated initial demands. Regarding U.S. domestic supports for agriculture, for example, Japanese Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Toshikatsu Matsuoka and EU Agriculture Commissioner Marianne Fischer-Boel recently pondered whether to jump-start the negotiations by asking the U.S. for a specific dollar figure in reduced supports. The problem for the EU, it was noted, is whether or not the proposed $17 billion mark is an acceptable point of departure, since U.S. supports at that level are judged to be in no way comparable to the breadth of market access that Brussels put on the table last July. A figure of $14 to $15 billion would be more in line with the EU's thinking, Fischer-Boel indicated. The EU also had concerns that Washington may be headed for a showdown with developing countries over special products. As for sensitive products, Fischer-Boel's deputy chef de cabinet, Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, hinted to the Japanese that the EU may be willing to go lower than its current official limit of 8 percent, possibly as low as 4 to 5 percent; however, that would be hard for Japan to accept. Borchardt also tried to allay Japanese fears that the EU might try again to enter into a bilateral, under-the-table deal with the U.S. (as had happened in Cancun in 2003), saying that Brussels had learned its lesson with respect to such back-door actions."
"Israel has reached out to Europe, including Italy, for help in smoothing out the current rift in its relations with the United States, according to Italian diplomatic reporting of 13 March. Speaking with Italian Prime Minister (PM) Silvio Berlusconi, Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu insisted that the trigger for the dispute--Israel's decision to build 1,600 homes in contested East Jerusalem--was totally in keeping with national policy dating back to the administration of Golda Meir, and blamed this mishandling on a government official with poor political sensitivity. The objective now, Netanyahu said, is to keep the Palestinians from using this issue as a pretext to block a resumption of talks or to advance unrealistic claims that could risk sinking the peace negotiations altogether. Continuing, he asserted that the tension has only been heightened by the absence of direct contact between himself and the U.S. President. In response, Berlusconi promised to put Italy at Israel's disposal in helping mend the latter's ties with Washington. Other Israeli officials, meanwhile, believed that this tiff goes far beyond merely the question of the construction plans, marking instead the lowest point in U.S.-Israeli relations in memory."
"Japan, preparing for its role as chairman of the Group-of-8 (G-8) summit at Lake Toya early in July, has given notice that it intends to strive for a long-term commitment on climate change with specific figures, while Germany believes that the crucial issue at the summit is whether the U.S. will accept going beyond Heiligendamm (the site of last year's G-8 summit) language in the framework of the G-8 if the emerging countries do not accept numerical targets at the Major Economies Meeting (MEM). (According to press reports, leaders from 16 countries, including the members of the G-8 plus China, India, Brazil, Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, South Africa, and Mexico, plan to discuss climate change on the margins of the G-8 summit in Japan.) Masaharu Kono, Japan's G-8 sherpa, emphasized Tokyo's position in an exchange with his German counterpart, Bernd Pfaffenback, on 17 June, while Pfaffenback provided his country's take on the issues to be addressed at Lake Toya. The German also noted that, in response to a U.S. request, his country would likely give up its demand for a 25- to 45-percent mid-term carbon dioxide reduction at the MEM. In addition, he does not believe that the emerging economies are willing to go beyond the Bali language at present, his feeling being that they prefer instead to wait until next year's G-8 summit in Copenhagen, because they do not wish to give up things now that they might be prepared to give up later. It is also Pfaffenback's position that a failure of the emerging economies to accept a long-term goal with numbers, even in brackets, would pose difficulties for the G-8 and possibly lead to a clash at the summit itself if there is no fallback position."

The sum of €5,200 alleged to have been left in the envelope is unusual, since one would expect the sum to have been a “round sum” such as €5000.

It should be noted that an interoffice memorandum from a former Airport Engineer to the KTA Procurement Specialist, dated 26 September 2002, alleged that the PEAP Official had accepted an open envelope of documents relating to the car park tender from Company 2, after the time for submission of bids had concluded and contrary to accepted procurement procedures on the handling of bids.

The Divisional Manager provided the ITF with a copy of documents passed to an UNMIK police officer, on 11 October 2002 at UNMIK Police in Fush, Kosovo, concerning the incident.

The documents consist of a letter from the Divisional Manager to the UNMIK Police Officer dated 11 October 2002, and a file note from the PEAP Official, dated 8 October 2002, to the Divisional Manager, detailing the incident and annexing a list of serial numbers of Euro notes totalling €5,200 alleged to have been left in the PEAP official’s diary in his office.""

"In February, 2002, DPKO Communications and Technology Services Division (CITS) sought to obtain a new systems contract for laptop computers. Mr. Cabrera was the procurement officer in the procurement department (PD) assigned to this matter. The Chief of CITS communicated his request to PD, and on February 25, 2002 an expression of interest was issued by PD. An invitation to bid followed on April 15, 2002 which was transmitted to 36 vendors from nine countries. CITS advised PD that they desired only “IBM, Dell and Compaq” based on ITSD standards for desktop computers. On the other hand, PD and the Information Technology Services Division (ITSD), involved in the process by Mr. Bahel, recommended adding Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC to the list. In a subsequent exchange of emails between PD and the requisitioner (CITS and ITSD), CITS continued to assert that they sought only the three major brands of computers to avoid “inferior products,” laptops from “questionable manufacturers,” “clones” and “home built computers.” Ultimately, however, CITS agreed that they were amenable to expanding the field to include other major brands of computer manufacturers who were recognized industry leaders. As a result, on April 24, 2002, the case officer, Mr. Cabrera, issued a bid amendment notification to the vendors correcting the anticipated quantity of the computers sought, and clarifying that that only “Compaq, Dell, IBM, Toshiba, Sony, Fujitsu and NEC” brands would be considered for solicitation. This is a report dealing with the matters raised (1) in the audit report dated 26 January 2006 PD/155/02 and (2) raised in other referrals concerning Mr. Walter Cabrera, procurement officer, Headquarters Procurement Section, at relevant times. The following sets forth the findings of the Procurement Task Force concerning United Nations staff member Walter Cabrera. INTRODUCTION The Procurement Task Force was created on January 12, 2006 to address all procurement matters referred to the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). The creation of the Task Force was the result of perceived problems in procurement identified by the Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil for Food Programme (IIC), and the arrest and conviction of UN procurement officer Alexander Yakovlev. Under its Terms of Reference, the Task Force operates as part of OIOS, and reports directly to the Under Secretary General of OIOS. The remit of the Task Force is to investigate all open and pending procurement cases, including all matters involving the procurement bidding exercises, procurement staff, and vendors doing business with the United Nations (hereinafter “UN” or “Organization”). The mandate of the Task Force also includes a review in some procurement matters which have been closed, but it is nevertheless determined that further investigative effort is warranted. The Task Force’s investigations have also focused upon a myriad of individuals and vendors doing business with the Organization. Some of these matters are particularly complex and span significant periods of time. Since its inception, more than 200 matters, involving numerous procurement cases in various UN Missions and UN Headquarters have been referred to the Task Force. The Task Force will report on matters individually. The Task Force has given priority to the matters involving the eight staff members placed on special leave with pay. The purpose of this report is to address the matters raised in the audit findings of January 2006 concerning Walter Cabrera, a United Nations procurement officer, and another matter brought to the attention of the Task Force through a separate referral. First, Mr. Cabrera is alleged to have improperly provided notification to a prospective vendor that approval had been granted in favor of the vendor, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird) for a contract to provide manpower support in UN Missions, prior to the official award of the contract. Secondly, the audit report found that Cabrera engaged in misconduct in connection with the procurement exercises in substantial contracts ultimately awarded to the firm Telecommunications Consultants of India (TCIL). The audit report found significant fraud indicators in connection with the procurement exercises in these contracts, a conclusion with which the Task Force agrees. (The Task Force will report on these issues in much more detail in a subsequent report addressing related matters). However, the focus of this report is upon the conduct of Mr. Cabrera individually, and whether Mr. Cabrera acted improperly in his participation in these matters. However, the investigation has revealed Mr. Bahel’s personal involvement in ensuring that the vendor, Thunderbird, received advanced notice of the likely award. Other than the HCC secretary, Mr. Bahel is also the only individual associated with the request for expedited approval in a position to seek it. The need for expedited approval for Thunderbird in the first instance and the effort to notify Thunderbird quickly of a likely award is questionable in light of the fact that in the same HCC meeting the current vendor, IECS, was granted an extension to continue for an additional two months, and that Thunderbird had failed to submit audited financial statements and was given an additional four weeks to accomplish the task. (However, Thunderbird took over eight weeks to file the forms). Thus, the basis for the intensive effort by Mr. Bahel to notify Thunderbird is problematic, especially in light of the fact that Thunderbird’s application was still not yet complete. Curiously, there is no request for advanced notification to IECS of the expedited approval of their extension.
While the minutes of the HCC meeting were pending and not yet finalized, however, a one page form had been issued by the HCC granting expedited approval for both the continuation of the current contractor, and for the replacement, Thunderbird. The circumstances surrounding the creation of this form and the request for expedited approval in the first instance are troubling, and are a continued subject of the Task Force’s investigation. However, at present, there is no evidence in the possession of the Task Force which demonstrates Mr. Cabrera participated in this aspect of the matter. After the HCC presentation, Mr. Bahel, who was scheduled to leave New York for annual leave, convened a meeting with Ms. Jane Redfern, a UN procurement officer, and Mr. Walter Cabrera prior to his departure. In this meeting, Mr. Bahel instructed them to notify Thunderbird of the recommendation to award the contract to them. According to Mr. Cabrera, he understood that he was not able to provide a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Thunderbird, but was able to give verbal notification of the HCC’s action based upon the document issued by the HCC. Mr. Cabrera’s understanding that this action was permissible was based upon the fact that his supervisor, Mr. Bahel, directed him to do it, as well as his independent understanding at the time. At the direction of Mr. Bahel, Mr. Cabrera did in fact notify Mr. Nishan Kohli that the HCC had recommended that the contract be awarded to Thunderbird and that Thunderbird would likely receive the contract. Mr. Cabrera asserts that he further notified Mr. Kohli that PD could not issue an LOI prior to receiving the approved HCC minutes and formal award of the contract. (Mr. Kohli’s explanation of the events in his written submission to the Organization through his attorney materially differs, however the Task Force does not find Mr. Kohli’s representations credible). On July 18, 2002, Sanjaya Bahel, the Officer in Charge of Procurement at the time, recommended the award to TCIL for a systems contract in the amount of US$5,340,000. In the presentation of the matter to the HCC, officials questioned the basis for limiting the bidding exercise to the three specified brands and intimated that the PD violated UN rules and regulations by the use of brand names in its ITB. Email communication after the event describes a circumstance in which DPKO officials are questioned about the limitation of the re-solicitation to the three preferred brands. The HCC stated that “were it not for the imminent loss of funds, the Committee would have recommended that a re-bidding exercise be conducted inviting all brands of laptops that met the UN’s requirement.” Nevertheless, the proposed contract award to TCIL was ultimately approved, and signed. Nonetheless, it is clear that a new invitation to bid (ITB) was issued. The basis for this renewed ITB however is not clear, nor is the identity of the individual(s) who sought it. The Task Force has not identified any evidence to support a finding that Mr. Cabrera was involved in the decision and the documents demonstrate that Mr. Cabrera continued to maintain a dialogue with DPKO concerning its requests. Further, the Task Force has not identified evidence which suggests Mr. Cabrera sought to cancel the bid, and then seek a re-bidding exercise. The investigation has revealed however that Mr. Cabrera’s supervisor, Sanjaya Bahel, was intimately involved in the matter, and interjected himself in it, communicating with ITSD officials and DPKO officials. The DPKO official referred to above stated that he had conversations with Mr. Bahel in which Mr. Bahel confirmed that PD was of the view that there was a technical issue with LaCresta’s bid, and there should be a new bidding exercise. The facts of this matter as they relate to Mr. Cabrera are not in dispute. In May, 2002, Thunderbird LLC (Thunderbird), through Mr. Nishan Kohli, its Managing Partner, had submitted an application in support of registering with the Organization as a vendor authorizing it to submit proposals on upcoming UN contracts. In July, 2002, after successfully being registered by PD, Thunderbird, through Nishan Kohli, submitted a proposal for the supply of engineering manpower to various UN Missions in response to the RFP issued by the Procurement Department. Ultimately, Mr. Sanjaya Bahel, Chief of Field Procurement, had made a presentation to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts (HCC) in favor of the award to Thunderbird. The matter had not been assigned to Mr. Cabrera until late December, 2002, and he was involved in the case only peripherally until that time. Procurement Department officials concede that at this point there was no further issue and there was no justification not to award the contract to LaCresta. Indeed, no justification is provided to La Cresta, or found in the file. It seems that La Cresta was not formally informed of the cancellation. (Typically the case officer maintains the responsibility for communicating the cancellation to the vendor.) In this case, there is no correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying them of the cancellation. A DPKO official involved in the process has informed the Task Force that in conversations with PD in this interim period, it was represented to him that PD had expressed a view that there was an “issue” with LaCresta’s submission. According to the official, the Procurement Department suggested a re-bid because of a “technicality.” While the official objected, he was told that because the matter is a commercial one it is only within PD’s prerogative to cancel the bid on the basis of commercial non-compliance. This explanation is not persuasive as there was no commercial or technical issue with LaCresta’s bid. DPKO had found La Cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder. Mr. Cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffered by PD to the DPKO official is not sound, but takes issue with any claim participation by him in the exchange or decision."
"""Another proposed topic was efforts by the European Aeronautic, Defense, and Space Corporation (EADS) to win a tanker aircraft contract with the U.S. military. Vimont revealed cryptically that the deal is moving forward but did not provide any details. Levitte had not expected to put the labeling dispute with Pernod Ricard (the world's second largest spirits group) on the agenda, but Sarkozy had just spoken to the company's chairman who had asked the president to intercede on his behalf. (COMMENT: Patrick Ricard, chairman of the Pernod Ricard board of directors, is said to be one of Sarkozy's wealthy backers.) Vimont characterized the issue as a very political matter in the U.S., and suggested that a direct appeal to the White House might be useful. While Sarkozy intends to broach the issue with the U.S. President, Levitte will talk to the U.S. President's Economic Adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser. Finally, Levitte expected the two leaders to discuss other pressing subjects including Iran, the Middle East Peace Process, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, the Sahel, Russia, China, Turkey, climate change, and the financial situation of several European countries; however, he provided no details on those topics.

The ambassador termed the report scandalous, since it named no U.S. companies and he claimed that many French companies with contracts under the OFF program were actually subsidiaries of U.S. firms that also profited from the business dealings. He therefore planned, with foreign ministry backing, to present a list of these U.S. companies to both the U.S. Congress and the media."""
